/***********************************************************************
 *				VMFileFree
 ***********************************************************************
 * SYNOPSIS:	    Release a region of the file, placing it on the
 *	    	    assigned list in the proper location.
 * CALLED BY:	    VMFree, VMWriteBlock (INTERNAL)
 * RETURN:	    Nothing
 * SIDE EFFECTS:    An unassigned handle may be taken and placed on
 *	    	    the assigned list.
 *
 * STRATEGY:
 *	- Locate the proper place in the assigned list for the block,
 *	keeping track of the preceding block.
 *	- If freed block follows directly after preceding block, up
 *	the size of the preceding block and shift the freed block handle
 *	to the unassigned list, making the preceding block the one
 *	at which we look for the next test.
 *	- If block is immediately before next block in the assigned list:
 *	    - If block was coalesced above, give the next block's space to
 *	    the combined block and place the next block on the unassigned list
 *	    - Else, give the freed block's space to the next block and place
 *	    the freed block on the unassigned list.
 *	- If can't coalesce either way, link freed block into assigned list.
