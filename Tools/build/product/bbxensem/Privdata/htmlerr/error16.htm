                      The computer hosting this web page has been found, but the web page information is not available.
                      The computer may be turned off or may be too busy to send the requested information.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      Click &quot;Reload&quot; in the &quot;View&quot; menu, for a
                      second request to send the web page information. Timing is everything.
                      Sometimes the host computer receives your request at the wrong time and cannot
                      respond.

                      If you get this message a second time, you can try
                      again at a later time. maybe the computer is
                      turned off. if you get this error at a later time,
                      then it is possible that the web page does not
                      exist.
