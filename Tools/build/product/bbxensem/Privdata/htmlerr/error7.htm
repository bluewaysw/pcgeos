                      The web page you have requested can't be contacted, because
                      your computer is not connected to a telephone line, or there is a problem
                      with your modem or with the telephone line.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                      To solve this, try these steps (you may want to write these
                      steps down or print this page):
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Make sure your computer is connected to the telephone line.</li>
                      <li>Make sure your modem is still connected to your ISP. Try
                      clicking &quot;Reload&quot; in the &quot;View&quot; menu, so the computer connects to the Internet
                      again.</li>
                      <li>If you are connected but you still receive this message,
                      exit Ensemble, turn the computer off, wait for a second, and then turn the
                      computer on again.</li>
                      <li>While the computer is restarting, check the telephone line
                      with a regular telephone to make sure it is still working properly. If you
                      can hear a dial tone and dial a number, it is working correctly.</li>
                      <li>After the computer starts up, try connecting to the Internet
                      again using WebMagick.</li>
