                      There was a technical error, possibly because too much of your
                      computer's memory is currently in use, or because a file has become corrupted.
                      To solve this, please try these steps (you may want to write these steps
                      down or print this page so you remember them):
                    </p>
                    <ol>
                      <li>Close any other programs you have open, then try clicking
                      &quot;Reload&quot; in the &quot;View&quot; menu.</li>
                      <li>If this message appears again, close WebMagick by clicking
                      &quot;File&quot;, &quot;Exit WebMagick&quot;.</li>
                      <li>Then, restart WebMagick and try viewing the web page again.</li>
                      <li>If this message still appears after that, it's possible
                      a file has become corrupted.</li>
