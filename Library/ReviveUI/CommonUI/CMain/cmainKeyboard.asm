SYNOPSIS:	Deal with a mouse press, converting to a key press.

CALLED BY:	InputMonitor()

PASS:		*ds:si	= VisKeyboard object
		es	= dgroup
		cx	= X position of mouse, in document coordinates of

DESTROYED:	none 
PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY: 	
		To allow the Keycaps application to function as a keyboard,
	 	it intercepts mouse presses and converts them to key presses if
		they fall inside the window and on the image of a particular
	 	key. It does this by finding the scan code and current 
		modifiers and from that finding the character value that is 
		currently displayed on the key. This information together 
		comprises the data for a MSG_META_KBD_CHAR, which replaces 
		the mouse press data in the input stream, and the rest of the 
		system is none the wiser...
