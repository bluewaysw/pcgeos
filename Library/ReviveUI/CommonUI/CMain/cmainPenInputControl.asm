	dlitwin	 4/18/94	Added call to superclass because we are

	dlitwin	4/27/94		Added in the code that used to be the

				because that has a different purpose now
				that we are in the SPUI.

COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		OLPenInputControlSetToDefaultPosition
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Set the PIC to its default position.

CALLED BY:	MSG_GEN_PEN_INPUT_CONTROL_SET_TO_DEFAULT_POSITION
PASS:		*ds:si	= OLPenInputControlClass object
		cx	= width of field
RETURN:		nothing
DESTROYED:	cx

SIDE EFFECTS:
	Potentially (if non-stylus) leaves a MSG_GEN_SET_WIN_CONSTRAIN
	(with WCT_KEEP_PARTIALLY_VISIBLE) on the front of the queue, so
	if you are going to bring up the PIC, make sure you send your
	MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_INITIATE with MF_FORCE_QUEUE and
	MF_INSERT_AT_FRONT *after* this message is handled, so it will
	then insert itself on the queue before the win constrain can 
	take effect.

	Things need to be done this way because of how the UI Application
	code brings up the keyboard, so you are really better off sending
	a MSG_GEN_PEN_INPUT_CONTROL_BRING_UP_EMBEDDED_KEYBOARD.

		says Zoomer, we update these objects to have Zoomer constants.

COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		SelectKeyboardObj
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	When the user changed the font type, we have to select
		back to the Keyboard obj.  Because the current
		keyboard layout is for other font and should not be
		available for the new font.

		In NIKE, this is a problem since Standard Keyboard has
		been removed.  Now, there is no common keyboard type
		among the different font types.  Thus, we need to
		check the font to set the keyboard type accordingly.

CALLED BY:	OLPICGenControlUpdateUi
PASS:		bx	= childBlock of the PenInputController
		cx	= FontID of the new font
RETURN:		nothing
DESTROYED:	nothing
