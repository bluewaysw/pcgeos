;	We've taken out support for drawing gstrings, as to do so 
; requires allocating a block (when loading the gstring), and this is
; a bit costly.  Also, it requires a separate block for the gstrings
; data to be in, because otherwise they would grow when being loaded
; which would invalidate our pointers into the VisKeymapData block,
; which is a *bad* thing.  I am, however, not going to nuke this code
; entirely, because it does work and could be conceivable useful in
; the future.		dlitwin 5/23/94
