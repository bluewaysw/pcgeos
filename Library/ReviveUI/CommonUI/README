		/staff/pcgeos/Library/CommonUI

This directory contains specific user-interface code which is common
to several of our specific user-interfaces, which means OpenLook and
Motif for now.

To actually pmake a specific ui, go to that directory ( pcgeos/Library/OpenLook
for example ) and run pmake from there. The Makefile in that directory
will do the right thing.

For now, the lion's share of OpenLook code is in this directory, because
we think a lot of it will be usable my Motif. As you find code in this
directory which is specific to OpenLook, make changes as follows:

    - one or more lines of code, but less than an entire procedure:
	
	In the .asm or .def file in this directory, use conditional
	assembly to separate the specific code from the common code:

			;this is common
		OL<	;this is for OpenLook only		>
		MO<	;this is for Motif only			>

    - one or more procedures of code: (lets use cwinButton.asm:)

	Move the OpenLook-specific procedures into OpenLook/CWin/winButton.asm.

	Update the CommonUI/CWin/cwinManager.asm file:

		if OPEN_LOOK
		#include	../../OpenLook/CWin/winButton.asm
		endif
		#include	cwinButton.asm

	Now you can edit the OpenLook/CWin/winButton.asm file, to make
	it OpenLook-specific, and will still have use of the common procedures
	in CommonUI/CWin/cwinButton.asm.
