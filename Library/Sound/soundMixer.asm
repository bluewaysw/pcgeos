DESCRIPTION:
	Mixer interface.

	Why, oh why, did I ever listen to Adam and put in a
	driver interface to the library?  It's a pointless step.
	GEOS will never go protected... and even if it did,
	everything would have to be rewritten anyway...

	The mixer code just talks straight to the registered
	drivers.  It doesn't bother with the LibDriver interface...

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
		Assume everything is stereo.
		If we're actually querying for a mono device,

			returns a StdSourceBehavior that let's
			them know this source is mono-only.
