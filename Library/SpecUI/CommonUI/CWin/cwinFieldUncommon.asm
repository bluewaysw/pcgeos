    INT OLFieldUpdateFullScreenCommon
				Handler for when field has lost the full

    MTD MSG_META_GET_TARGET_AT_TARGET_LEVEL
				Returns current target object within this
				branch of the hierarchical target
				exclusive, at level requested

    MTD MSG_META_START_SELECT   Process case of menu button being pressed
				in workspace area.

    MTD MSG_META_START_SELECT   Process case of menu button being pressed
				in workspace area.

    MTD MSG_OL_FIELD_POPUP_EXPRESS_MENU
				Pop up the workspace menu, at the specified
				location

    MTD MSG_OL_FIELD_TOGGLE_EXPRESS_MENU
				Open/close field's express menu.

    MTD MSG_OL_FIELD_SELECT_WINDOW_LIST_ENTRY
				Brings window to front

    MTD MSG_OL_FIELD_WINDOW_LIST_CLOSE_WINDOW
				Close the window currently selected in the
				window list.

    MTD MSG_GEN_FIELD_OPEN_WINDOW_LIST
				Bring up the window list dialog

    MTD MSG_OL_FIELD_CLOSE_WINDOW_LIST
				Close the window list.

    MTD MSG_OL_WIN_CLOSE        Handle specific UI close message releasing
				the target so the window list will go away.

    MTD MSG_META_FUP_KBD_CHAR   On a DELETE keypress, we want to close the
				currently selected window.

    MTD MSG_META_GAINED_TARGET_EXCL
				Make sure the Express Menu is hidden when
				the window list come up.

    MTD MSG_META_LOST_TARGET_EXCL
				Since we do not have a GenApplication above
				us, we need to provide some extra code to
				make we lose sys target.

    MTD MSG_GEN_GUP_INTERACTION_COMMAND
				Make sure target goes somewhere when the
				window list is closed.

    MTD MSG_VIS_VUP_TERMINATE_ACTIVE_MOUSE_FUNCTION
				Copied from OLAppSendToFlow because
				WindowListDialog is not under an
				OLApplication.

    MTD MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_INITIATE
				Hide the tool area immediately after it is
				initiated.

    MTD MSG_META_MUP_ALTER_FTVMC_EXCL
				Intercept change of focus within tool area
				to give this app & window the focus, as
				long as a child has the focus within the
				dialog.

    MTD MSG_GEN_BRING_TO_TOP    Brings tool area to the top.  We subclass
				this merely to avoid giving the focus to
				it.  This is done in ToolAreaAlter-
				FTVMCExcl, and there seems to be a problem
				doing it in both places.

    MTD MSG_SPEC_GUP_QUERY_VIS_PARENT
				direct requests for vis parent to UIApp

		MENU causes the workspace menu to come up, in non-stay-up

	a transition is made to stay-up mode.
	In stay up mode, the menu button is undepressed.  In non-stay-up
	mode, the button will stay depressed until the menu should be
	taken down, which occurs when the button is notified of having
	lost the active exclusive from its UI window.

	States:
	OLFI_menuTimer			- time at which button was pressed
					  on button such that a menu was
					  brought up.
