SYNOPSIS:	This routine takes a StandardSoundType in AX and plays the
		sound accordingly. All UI sounds should go through this
		routine, because it checks to see if the user has turned sound
		on or off.

CALLED BY:	GLOBAL
PASS:		ax - StandardSoundType

	; NOTE: The stream is given a priority of SP_SYSTEM_LEVEL
	; and the tempo set at 8 msec/128th note (rather quick...)

FUNCTION:	UserLoadApplication

DESCRIPTION:	Loads a GEOS application.  Changes to standard application
		directory before attempting GeodeLoad on filename passed.
		Stores the filename being launched into the AppLaunchBlock,
		so that information needed to restore this application 
		instance will be around later if needed.

		NOTE: Ownership of the launch block is transferred to the
		new geode and will be freed by it. If the application cannot
		be loaded, the block will be freed here. ON NO ACCOUNT SHOULD
		A PASSED AppLaunchBlock BE REFERRED TO AFTER THIS FUNCTION
		RETURNS.

CALLED BY:	GLOBAL

PASS:
	ah	- AppLaunchFlags (0 for default)
			mask ALF_SEND_LAUNCH_REQUEST_TO_UI_TO_HANDLE set if
			the actual launch should be done later by the UI, in
			a safe memory situation (no error code returned in 
			this case)  If this flag is clear, then the caller
			should be calling from a fixed memory space, such
			that none of their movable code segments are locked.
			This is to provide the most favorable memory conditions
			for the new app to be loaded in.

	cx	- Application attach mode method, currently, one of:
		  0 - use appMode in AppLaunchBlock passed, or if none
		  there, use the default mode.  If this is non-zero,
		  any appMode in the launch block is overridden.

		  MSG_GEN_PROCESS_RESTORE_FROM_STATE
			State file MUST be passed, no data file should be
		  MSG_GEN_PROCESS_OPEN_APPLICATION
			State file normally should NOT be passed, although
			one could be to accomplish ui templates. A data
			file may be passed into the application as well
		  MSG_GEN_PROCESS_OPEN_ENGINE
			State file normally should NOT be passed.
			The data file on which the engine will operate
			MUST be passed.  If 0, the default data file should
			be used (Enforced by app, not GenProcessClass)

	dx	- Block handle of structure AppLaunchBlock (must be shareable),
		  or 0 for:
			* Mode = OPEN_APPLICATION
			* No data file
			* No template statefile
			* Launch in current default field
			* Current directory is data directory passed to app
		  
	If si  = -1, then full pathname/filename/diskhandle is stored in
		     AppLaunchBlock.
	If si != -1, then either:
		    ds:si = absolute path of file to load (no drive letter), and
		    bx = handle of disk on which the file resides

		    or

		    ds:si = file to load (no path) from either SP_APPLICATION
			or SP_SYS_APPLICATION, and
		    bx = StandardPath to use
		(ds:si *can* be pointing to the movable XIP code resource.)	
		Either of these takes precedence over data stored in any passed
		AppLaunchBlock.

RETURN:
	bx - geode process handle
	carry - clear if no error
		ax - segment of geode's core block
	carry - set if error
		ax - error code (GeodeLoadError)
DESTROYED:
	Nothing
	WARNING:  This routine MAY resize LMem and/or object blocks, moving
		  them on the heap and invalidating stored segment pointers
		  to them.
