;  FULL_EXECUTE_IN_PLACE : Indicates that the spreadsheet lib is going to

;  The .GP file only understands defined/not defined;
;  it can not deal with expression evaluation.
;  Thus, for the TRUE/FALSE conditionals, we define
;  GP symbols that _only_ get defined when the
;  condition is true.

; This is the default setting for all the flags for regular Spreadsheet lib. By
; default, all the flags are "on". If you need to cut any of the following
; features, then you can set the particular flags "off".
; _CHARTS	:	If this flag is "on", Spreadsheet lib will provide
;			charting features, and the user is also able to create
;			graphical objects.
; _PROTECT_CELL	:	If this flag is "on", Spreadsheet lib will provide
;			the cell protection feature. Since this is the new
;			feature, we don't use it in regular GeoCalc until
;			it is found to be stable.
; _GRID_PRINTING:	If this flag is "on", Spreadhseet lib will always
;			allow sufficient room for printing the grid lines
;			around the outside of a document. Without this,
;			the right or bottom grid line can be missing from
;			a printout. The cost of turning on this flag is
;			one less column can be printed on a piece of
;			US Letter-sized paper, when using the default
;			column widths
; _SCROLL_PARTLY_VISIBLE_CELL_ON_SCREEN_ONLY_WITH_KBD
;			If a cell is selected and if it is partly visible,
;			having this flag set to TRUE will cause the
;			spreadsheet to scroll the window in order to bring
;			the entire cell onto the screen, only if the
;			cell was moved to via the keyboard. If the user
;			clicked on the cell, then it is not scrolled on
;			to the screen.
;	
;			This is FALSE by default, in order to maintain the
;			traditional behavior. Setting it to TRUE gives
;			the nicer behavior.
;
; _CHECK_LIMIT_FOR_FILL
;			Checks to see if the amount of area that will
;			be filled is larger than the transferLimit,
;			and if it is, then the user gets a dialog box
;			telling them that only part of the area will be
;			filled, and then only part of the area is filled.
;
;			This helps to reduce the problem of the user filling
;			the spreadsheet and getting a crash because
;			the new huge spreadsheet is using all of memory.
;
;			This is FALSE by default to preserve the old behavior.
;
; _USE_UI_DEFAULT_FOR_RULER_FONT_AND_SIZE
;			Use the system's default font & size instead of
;			a pre-defined font/size determined by this library
;			Turning this on results in *slightly* slower
;			drawing of the rulers.
