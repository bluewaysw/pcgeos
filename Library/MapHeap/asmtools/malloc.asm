	; When multiple geodes use this library at the same time, the winInfo
	; variable will be shared.  But it's okay because SysGetUtilWindowInfo
	; always return the same info in this structure anyway.
	;
	; However, even though in practice SysGetUtilWindowInfo only writes
	; valid data into winInfo while it is executing, in theory it can
	; write anything into the variable before it writes valid data and
	; returns.  Then it'll be bad if one thread is in SysGetUtilWindowInfo
	; and another thread is reading winInfo.  So we need to use a
	; semaphore to protect winInfo to prevent this theoretical problem.
	;
	; An alternative is to keep a separate winInfo for each geode using
	; us.  But that takes more memory for the data and doesn't seem to
	; take fewer bytes for the code.
	;
	; A better way is to use a thread lock instead of a semaphore, but
	; that would take more bytes for the code.  The slight loss of
	; parallelism from using a semaphore is not important here.
