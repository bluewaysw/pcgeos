REGISTER/STACK USAGE:

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	FloatFloatToAscii is a big body of code!

	A FloatFloatToAsciiFixed routine exists to format fixed format numbers
	quickly. Some demands may exceed its ability, so once this is detected,
	it bails and the generalized (& significantly slower) FloatFloatToAscii
	routine takes over.

FUNCTION:	Intel80X87FloatToAscii_StdFormat

DESCRIPTION:	Converts the floating point number into an ASCII string
		in the format specified by al.
		
		This routine provides a way to obtain an ASCII string from
		a floating point number without having to deal with the
		FFA_stackFrame.

		!!! NOTE !!!
		Rounding is based on decimalDigits and not total Digits.

CALLED BY:	GLOBAL ()

PASS:		ax - FloatFloatToAsciiFormatFlags

		    Flags permitted:

		    FFAF_FROM_ADDR - source of number
			If FFAF_FROM_ADDR=1,
			    Use the number at the given address
			    ds:si - location
			If FFAF_FROM_ADDR=0,
			    Use number from the fp stack.
			    Number will be popped
		    FFAF_SCIENTIFIC - scientific format
			If FFAF_SCIENTIFIC=1,
			    Returns numbers in the form x.xxxE+xxx
			    in accordance with bh and bl
			    Numbers are normalized ie. the mantissa m satisfies
				1 <= m < 10
			If FFAF_SCIENTIFIC=0,
			    Returns numbers in the form xxx.xxx
			    in accordance with bh and bl
		    FFAF_PERCENT - percentage format
			Returns numbers in the form xxx.xxx%
			in accordance with bh and bl
		    FFAF_USE_COMMAS
		    FFAF_NO_TRAIL_ZEROS

		bh - number of significant digits desired (>=1)
		     (A significant digit is a decimal digit derived from
		     the floating point number's mantissa and it may preceed
		     or follow a decimal point).

		     Fixed format numbers that require more digits than limited
		     will be forced into scientific notation.

		bl - number of fractional digits desired (ie. number of
		     digits following the decimal point)

		es:di - destination address of string
		    this buffer must either be FLOAT_TO_ASCII_NORMAL_BUF_LEN or
		    FLOAT_TO_ASCII_HUGE_BUF_LEN in size (see math.def)

		NOTE:
		-----

		* Numbers are rounded away from 0.
		  eg. if number of fractional digits desired = 1,
		      0.56 will round to 1
		      -0.56 will round to -1

SYNOPSIS:	put a random number on the fp stack

CALLED BY:	GLOBAL

PASS:		nothing

RETURN:		carry set on error

DESTROYED:	ax

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	We want to generate a number such that a list of such generated numbers
	will satisfy all of the statistical tests that a random sequence
	would satisfy.

	Algorithm taken from Knuth Vol 2 Chapter 3 - Random Numbers
	-----------------------------------------------------------

	The linear congruential method:

	The detailed investigations suggest that the following procedure
	will generate "nice" and "simple" random numbers.  At the beginning
	of the program, set an integer variable X to some value Xo.  This
	variable X is to be used only for the purpose of random number
	generation. Whenever a new random number is required by the program,
	set
		X <- (aX + c) mod m
	
	and use the new value of X as the random value.  It is necessary to
	choose Xo, a, c, and m properly, according to the following principles:

	1)  The "seed" number Xo may be chosen arbitrarily.  We use the
	    current date and time since that is convenient.
	
	2)  The number m should be large, say at least 2^30.  The computation
	    of (aX + c)mod m must be done exactly, with no roundoff error.
	
	3)  If m is a power of 2, pick a so that a mod 8 = 5.
	    If m is a power of 10, choose a so that a mod 200 = 21.

	    The choice of a together with the choice of c given below
	    ensures that the random number generator will produce all
	    m different possible values of X before it starts to repeat
	    and ensures high "potency".

	4)  The multiplier a should preferably be chosen between 0.01m
	    0.99m, and its binary or decimal digits should not have a simple
	    regular pattern.  By choosing a = 314159261 (which satisfies
	    both of the conditions in 3), one almost always obtains a
	    reasonably good multiplier.  There are several tests that can
	    be performed before it is considered to have a truly clean
	    bill of health.
	
	5)  The value of c is immaterial when a is a good multiplier,
	    except that c must have no factor in common with m.
	    Thus we may choose c=1 or c=a.
	
	6)  The least significant digits of X are not very random, so
	    decisions based on the number X should always be influenced
	    primarily by the most significant digits.

	    It is generally best to think of X as a random fraction
	    between 0 and 1.  To compute a random integer between 0
	    and k-1, one should multiply by k and truncate the result.
	
	Implementation notes:
	---------------------

	Desirable properties:

	* the same seed generates the same sequence of random numbers

	* 2 different threads accessing the routine will not lose
	  their "place" in the random number sequence.  This is important
	  because the property of Uniform Distribution will be adversely
	  affected if one thread's behaviour can alter the next number
	  seen by another thread.

	  This "state" is wholly represented by X since the other
	  parameters a, c, and m are hardwired in the code.  The
	  question then is where to save X.  We can force the user
	  to preserve X on the floating point stack but that may
	  be inconvenient because the caller will then have to
	  place calls to FloatDup to duplicate the number and pop
	  it off when done.

	  We instead save X in the floating point stack header.
	  This costs 5 words and it seems affordable.

DESCRIPTION:	Given a parsed string, convert it into a floating point
		number.

CALLED BY:	GLOBAL ()

PASS:		al - FloatAsciiToFloatFlags
		    FAF_PUSH_RESULT - place result onto the fp stack
		    FAF_STORE_NUMBER - store result into the location given by
			es:di
		cx - number of characters in the string that the routine

		ds:si - string in this format:

		    "[+-] dddd.dddd [Ee] [+-] dddd"

		    Notes:
		    ------

		    * The string is assumed to be legal because duplicating
		    the error checking that is done in the parser seems
		    unnecessary.

		    * There can be at most a single decimal point.

		    * Spaces and thousands seperators are ignored.

		because the only thing we get in hardware is
		2^x - 1 when 0 <= x <= .5 we must do some silly things

		since 2^x = (2^integerpart(x))(2^fractionalpart(x))
		
		first, if x is negative, set sign = minus, x = -x;

		we can do the following :
			let y = integerpart(x)
			let z = fractionalpart(x)
			
			now to get s = 2^y do the following
			s = 1;
			while (y--)
				s*=2;

			now if z <= .5 we can just call 2xm1 and add 1
			else let z = z - .5, and do a 2xm1 and add 1
				and the do another 2xm1 add 1 on remaining z


			if (sign == minus) we must invert the answer

PASS:		ax = new value for top of stack pointer

RETURN:		carry set on error

DESTROYED:	Nada.

PSEUDOCODE/STRATEGY:	

		the new value passes must be >= current value of top of stack

KNOWN BUGS/SIDEFFECTS/IDEAS:
		Primarily for use by applications for error recovery.
		Applications can bail out of involved operations by saving
		the stack pointer prior to commencing operations and
		restoring the stack pointer in the event of an error.

		NOTE:
		-----
		If you set the stack pointer, the current stack pointer
		must be greater than or equal to the value you pass. Ie.
		you must be throwing something (or nothing) away.
