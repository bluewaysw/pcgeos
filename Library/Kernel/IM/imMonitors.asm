SYNOPSIS:	Removes a monitor from the linked list after it returns
		from executing, or, optionally, after it has no more data
		to return.  NOTE:  This routine should never be called from
		within a Monitor.  Only the routine owning the block of
		memory that the Monitor resides in should call this routine.

CALLED BY:	EXTERNAL

			  be set:

			  MF_REMOVE_WHEN_EMPTY	equ	80h
			  MF_REMOVE_IMMEDIATE	equ	40h

			  Remove when empty option will wait until Monitor
			  has no more data to return before removing.  Remove
			  immediate will remove it as soon as it is not
			  processing data.

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	A drag event for a button should only be sent if
	the corresponding bit in dragState is set and one of the following
	is true.

	The distance between the button press and the position of this
	IM_PTR_CHANGE event is greater than ds:[dragDistance]

				OR

	The time elapsed between the pressing of the button and sending
	of this IM_PTR_CHANGE event is greater than ds:[dragTime]

	The time stored is only the low 14 bits of the time counter at the
	time the IM_PTR_CHANGE event is sent. This value doesn't wrap for
	over 4 minutes, so that shouldn't be a problem. But to calc the
	difference we must do the following.

		if ptr event time => press time
			diff = ptr event time - press time
		else
			diff = (ptr event time + (2^14) - 1 ) - press time

COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		CheckForLostDrag
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Determine if we need to send a drag event before we send
		the release event.

CALLED BY:	INTERNAL
		ProcessButton

PASS:
	bp - button info
	cx - low word of time of button event
	ds - segment of dgroup
		ds:[displayXPos] position of current button event
		ds:[displayYPos] position of current button event

		bit for button is cleared in ds:[dragState]
		ds:[delayedRelease] - 1
		ds:[delayedReleaseEvent] - delayed event data
DESTROYED:
	nothing

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	Consider this:
	The user clicks, moves less than the dragDistance but keeps the
	button pressed for at least the dragTime and then releases.
	However, the input manager is backlogged and doesn`t start
	processing the button press until after the user has released.
	Since the dragDistance wasn't violated we are depending upon the
	timer started when processing the button press to send us a ptr
	event after the dragTime has passed. But since the release has
	already happened, it will be in the queue before the timer
	generated ptr event. And if the button is released we don't send
	a drag event when the ptr event comes in. Got it. So, upon the
	release we check and see if we need to send the drag event
	before the release event. If so, we save the release event data,
	send of the drag event and tell the monitor chain to come back
	to us so we can then send the release event. Yeah.

COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		OutputMonitor
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	LEVEL 100 user input processing. Unloads result of input
		chain to whatever process has set itself up to receive
		the output of the IM (Should be the UI).

		- INPUT DATA SENT TO OUTPUT PROCESS

CALLED BY:

PASS:		al 		- MF_DATA
		di 		- event type
				  (or 0 if to retrieve additional data)
		cx, dx, bp, si 	- event data
		ss:sp 		- stack frame of Input Manager



RETURN:		AL = 0, indicating no more to come, & Nothing being returned
		es unchanged

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
		If MSG_META_MOUSE_PTR {
			Limit ptr to screen limits
			If ptr has moved from last drawn position {
				store new drawn position vars;
				move ptr;
			}
			If grab not requesting ptr movement, don't pass on to
				next monitor;
			Send event to outputProcess using custom combine
				routine to compress PTR data;
		} elsif MSG_META_MOUSE_BUTTON {
			Increment # of unprocessed events regarding this button
		} else send EVENT to outputProcess;


KNOWN BUGS/SIDE EFFECTS/IDEAS:
		none
