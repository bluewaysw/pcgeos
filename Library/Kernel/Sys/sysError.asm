		SysNotify
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Put the SysNotify box up on the current screen

CALLED BY:	SysNotify (Kernel)
PASS:		ax - SysNotifyFlags
		ds:si - first string to print (si = 0 for none)
		ds:di - second string to print (di = 0 for none)

RETURN:		If SNF_RETRY, SNF_ABORT, SNF_CONTINUE or SNF_EXIT passed and
		selected, returns same in ax to indicate action caller should
		take.
		
		If SNF_REBOOT passed and selected, this routine doesn't return.
