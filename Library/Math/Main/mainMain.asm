	; coprocessor library uses us, and we are unknown to whoever is

	; we get an extra LCT_CLIENT_THREAD_EXIT, after having set

REGISTER/STACK USAGE:

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:

	when we first load in the library (by the kernel) we must do a
	bunch of thing:

	1) Allocate a word of the ThreadPrivateData mini-heap to use for
	   storing the handle of each thread's FP stack.

	2) check the INI file for coprocessor information

		i) if they have a corprocessor listed, load in the
		   appropriate hardware library

		ii) otherwise do a detection to see if they have a 80x87

		iii) if no coprocessor just use emulation (i.e. do nothing)
