    INT ExportDIB		Exports a GString to the DIB format. The
				resulting bitmap is stored in the indicated
				file

    INT ETDDeleteTempFile	destroy Temp File and Bitmap in it

    INT ETDSetBitmapType	set the BMType according to the bitcount-
				will be complex with a palette, unless
				24bit

    INT ETDCreateTempVMFile	Creates a temp VM File- this will be used
				to play The Gstring into- Creating a bitmap
				which can then be converted out to DIB

    INT ETDCBitmapToDIB		Write out a slice of scanlines into the
				specified DIB File

    INT ETDSetUpDIBHeader	Sets up the DIB FIle Header and DIB info
				header in the specified file. These
				structures are as follows: FILEHEADER:
				DBFH_type	BitmapType
				DBFH_size	dword
				DBFH_reserved	dword
				DBFH_offBit	dword

    INT ETDWritePaletteToDIB	Writes the default Geos color table to the
				DIB file specified

    INT ETDCalculateStripSizeAndOffset calculates the number of scanlines
				that will fit in a 100K block, as well as
				the offset to translate the bitmap such
				that any remain. scanlines(remainder of
				scanlines/(scanlines/block)) will be
				handled first. The DIB format has the
				origin at the lower left, and the CBitmap's
				origin is the upper left, therefore, the
				last scanline in the DIB is the first one
				in the bitmap.

DESCRIPTION:
	The routines in this file export a Gstring to a Device Independent
	Bitmap(DIB). The DIB will then be processed by one of the bitmap
	translation libraries which will take the DIB as input and output
	the appropriate format.

SYNOPSIS:	Exports a GString to the DIB format. The resulting
		bitmap is stored in the indicated file	

CALLED BY:	ImpexExportGraphicsConvertToDIBMetafile	
PASS:		
		bx	-VMFile		hptr
		si	-VMBlock	hptr
		di	-DIBFile	(lower word of stream pointer)
		cx	-ClipboardItemFormat( CIF_BITMAP or CIF_GRAPHICS_STRING)
		dx	-Bitcount	word
		ax	-maufacturer's ID

RETURN:		ax	-will be zero if the export was successful
			 otherwise will contain TransError
		bx:	-if ax = TE_CUSTOM will contain handle of error text

DESTROYED:	nothing

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	*Lock the block to access ExportFrame
	*Calculate StripSize and the number of strips:
		stripsize = num scanlines that fit in 100k block
		numStrips = num 100k blocks needed to hold bitmap
	  (the idea here is to repeatedly play the Gstring into a VM Bitmap,
	   which is of 100k block size or less,and translate it each time.In
	   this way only 100k of data is produced each time,keeping down the
	   memory allocation, and the window is just moved down the bitmap,
	   in order that the entire bitmap is produced, one chunk at a time.)
	*Setup the DIB header 
	*Create bitmap in a temp VMFile,setting type as specified in the
	   export options and vertical size stripsize
	*load the Gstring
	*For Num Strips:
		play Gstring into Bitmap
		write out scanlines to DIB
		Translate so next chunk of bitmap data will be generated
	*clean up- destroy VM and Bitmap
	
KNOWN BUGS/SIDE EFFECTS/IDEAS:
	* the DIB source file stream pointer is passed to the DIB Library
	 in bx. This is actually  the low word of the stream pointer,
	 as the high word is always  zero.
	 ALL OF THE FOLLOWING DIB ROUTINES DEPEND UPON THIS!!!

SYNOPSIS:	Writes the default Geos color table to the DIB file
		specified	

CALLED BY:	SetUpDIBHeader		
PASS:		bx   -DIBFile (lower word of stream pointer)
		dx   -size color table
		cx   -numEntries		
RETURN:		carry set if error
		error in ax-

DESTROYED:	nothing

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
		-calls GrGetPalette, which will return all 256 RGB
		 triples
		-Writes out the appropriate number to a DIB File, first 
		 converting the triples into DIB RGBQuad format:		 			i.e. RGBQuad{
					BYTE	rgbBlue;
					BYTE	rgbGreen;
					BYTE	rgbRed;
					BYTE	rgbReserved;

COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		ETDCalculateStripSizeAndOffset
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
SYNOPSIS:	calculates the number of scanlines that will fit into our
		temporary bitmap (of size DIB_EXPORT_BUFF_SIZE), as well as
		the offset to translate the bitmap such that any remaining
		scanlines(remainder of scanlines/(scanlines/block)) will be
		handled first. The DIB format has the origin at the lower
		left, and the CBitmap's origin is the upper left, therefore,
		the last scanline in the DIB is the first one in the bitmap.
