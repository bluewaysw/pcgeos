COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		EmitTextField
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Generate code for a GrDrawTextField element

CALLED BY:	INTERNAL
		TranslateGString

PASS:		si		- handle to gstring
		bx		- gstring opcode (in kind of a twisted way)
		tgs		- inherited local stack frame

RETURN:		nothing

DESTROYED:	nothing

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
                For GrDrawTextField elements, the text is drawn as a group
		of consecutive style runs (I call this a styles group).  A
		styles group can represent an entire GrDrawTextField element,
		or just a subset.  The difference is that the styles group
		does not have any embedded graphics.

		Each style group is passed on the stack as an array of
		style runs.  Each style run is an array of other info.  The
		structure of a style run is:

	[(string) {attr-info} <track kern> <style matrix> <font> <size>]

		where:
			(string)        - the text string to draw, in parens
			{attr-info}     - commands to set attributes, in curly
					  braces
			<track kern>    - track kerning for style run
			<style-matrix>  - transformation matrix to effect the
					  current style
			<font>          - a valid PostScript font name
			<size>          - the current pointsize

		 These style runs are then strung together on the stack:

		 [ [style-run] [style-run] ... ]

		Finally, the styles group is followed by the space padding,
		the string width (under GEOS) and the position

KNOWN BUGS/SIDE EFFECTS/IDEAS:
		none

SYNOPSIS:	Since the standard character set in PS doesn't have these

		style runs to take care of them.

CALLED BY:	INTERNAL
		HandleStyleRun

PASS:		ds:bx	 - pointer to element
		ds:bx+si - pointer to TFStyleRun structure
		ds:dx    - pointer to text to draw
		cx	 - #chars in this style run
		di	 - gstate handle
		es	 - points to locked options block

RETURN:		carry	- set if we've finished with the style run
		everything else intact

DESTROYED:	nothing

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
		scan the string for suspicious chars.  If any found, kill 
		them.  No, actually, just take them prisoner.
