;
;	Because the macro DefTransLib defines the data format
;	enumeration (TransFormat), we must define a seperate define
;	for use in the ./Export and ./Import directories.  Problem
;	is that the TF_xxx define is only known in the ./Lib directory.
;	The smallest-effect change is to adapt and not change the
;	file "I/Internal/xlatLib.def".
;
;	This enumeration must match the TF_xxx defines in libFormat.asm.
