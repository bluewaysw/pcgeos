SYNOPSIS:	Force a domain to close a given medium

CALLED BY:	GLOBAL

PASS:		ds:si	- domain name

SIDE EFFECTS:	

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	If ax=0, a link will not be closed if there is a connection
	over it.  If ax=1, it will be closed regardless.

	Carry is returned if either:
	   * no links exist in the domain and medium specified
	   * a link exists but is busy, and force close was not specified

COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		SocketSetMediumBusy
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Set whether the given medium looks busy even when
		there are no active connections.  Medium should
		be restored to normal as soon as medium may be
		allowed to close.

CALLED BY:	GLOBAL

PASS:		ds:si	= domain name 
		dxbx	= MediumAndUnit
		cx	= TRUE to mark medium always busy
			  FALSE to return medium to normal

RETURN:		carry set if error

DESTROYED:	nothing

NOTES:
		Should only be used by applications wishing to prevent
		non-forcing SocketCloseDomainMedium from closing the
		medium when there are no active connections.  An
		example would be an application which makes a series
		of connections with pauses between each connection
		and doesn't want the medium closed during a pause.
