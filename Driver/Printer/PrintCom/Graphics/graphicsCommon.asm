		LoadSwathHeader
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Takes a HugeArray bitmap and loads it's bitmap header into
		the PState

CALLED BY:	PrintSwath

PASS:		es	- pointer to locked PState
		dx.cx	- VM file and block handle for HugeArray bitmap

RETURN:		nothing
DESTROYED:	ax

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
		save the VM file handle
		lock the VM block;
		copy the header into into the PState;
		unlock the block;
