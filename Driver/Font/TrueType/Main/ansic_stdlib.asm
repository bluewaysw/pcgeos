PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	Set up stack frame with _qsort_callback as the callback
	to be called from ChunkArrayQuickSort, which inherits only the 
        CQSP_common portion of the frame. _qsort_callback
	inherits qsort's entire stack frame and calls the callback
	originally passed as an argument to qsort.

		_qsort_callback
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

FUNCTION:	_qsort_callback

DESCRIPTION:	Callback routine for qsort

CALLED BY:	ChunkArrayQuickSort (via qsort)

PASS:		ds:si - first element
		es:di - second element (ds = es)
		ss:bp - inherited CQuickSortParameters

RETURN:		Flags set so ChunkArrayQuickSort can jl, je, or jg
		according to whether the first element is less than,
		equal to, or greater than the second

DESTROYED:	ax

REGISTER/STACK USAGE:

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
		See explanation for qsort, above.

KNOWN BUGS/SIDE EFFECTS/IDEAS:
		The callback called by this routine is of the form:
			      int (*compare)(const void *, const void *));
