		; this is really simple, folks.  The REAL DriverStrategy 
		; routine (well, the one you normally see for video drivers)
		; is executed in each individual module of vidmem.  So there 
		; is one for Mono, one for Color4, etc.  But many of the normal
		; driver functions are NULL for vidmem (pointer, save-under...)
		; so they are handled locally.  Basically, all we do here is 
		; either call into one of the modules or call a local routine.
		; yawn.

		; Of course, we also need to deal with escape codes.  So check
		; that first.
