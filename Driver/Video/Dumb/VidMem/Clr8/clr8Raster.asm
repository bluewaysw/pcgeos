SYNOPSIS:	blt a single scan line 

CALLED BY:	INTERNAL

PASS:		bx	- first x point in simple region
		ax	- last x point in simple region
		d_x1	- left side of blt
		d_x2	- right side of blt
		es:si	- points to scan line start of source
		es:di	- points to scan line start of dest


RETURN:		nothing

DESTROYED:	ax,bx,cx,dx,si,di

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
		if source is to right of destination
		   mask left;
		   copy left byte;
		   mask = ff;
		   copy middle bytes
		   mask right;
		   copy right byte;
		else
		   do the same, but from right to left
