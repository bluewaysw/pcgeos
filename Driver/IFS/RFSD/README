This is a text describing some of the peculiar behaviors regarding the RFSD,
as it functions now.

.....

File Change Notification:

The file change notification does not correctly work with RFSD.  In order to
make it work properly, the Dispatch thread should intercept the appropriate
messages (GCN?) and route it to the remote side dispatch thread to be handled
correctly.

Note:  The dispatch thread is the only event-driven thread used by the RFSD.
this is why it must be the one doing the work.  another method would be to
spawn a completely new thread to handle file change notifications only (and
any other future event messages to be intercepted.)
