DESCRIPTION:
	Device-dependent support for PS2 mouse port. The PS2 BIOS defines
	a protocol that all mice connected to the port employ. Rather
	than interpreting it ourselves, we trust the BIOS to be efficient
	and just register a routine with it. Keeps the driver smaller and
	avoids problems with incompatibility etc.

SYNOPSIS:	HandleMem the receipt of an interrupt

CALLED BY:	BIOS
PASS:		ON STACK:
RETURN:		Nothing
DESTROYED:	Nothing

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	Overflow is ignored.

	For delta Y, positive => up, which is the opposite of what we think

KNOWN BUGS/SIDE EFFECTS/IDEAS:
	Some BIOSes rely on DS not being altered, while others do not.
	To err on the side of safety, we save everything we biff.

SYNOPSIS:	Callback routine for on/off notification

CALLED BY:	Power driver
PASS:		ax	= PowerNotifyChange
RETURN:		nothing
DESTROYED:	nothing
SIDE EFFECTS:	

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	Here's the scenario:

	If the mouse is not connected, both MOUSE_ENABLE_DISABLE(BH=1) and
	MOUSE_GET_TYPE return MS_INTERACE_ERROR.

	If the mouse was disconnected and then re-connected, it defaults to
	disabled state.  At this point Both MOUSE_GET_TYPE and
	MOUSE_ENABLE_DISABLE(BH=1) return no error.

	We can use MOUSE_GET_TYPE to check if the mouse is connected without
	touching its state, and inform the user if it's not.  But if we find
	that it is connected, we then have no way to check if it is enabled or
	not.  Then we still have to enable it again to make sure it is
	enabled.

	So, to simplify things, we just re-eanble the mouse and check for any
	errors.  The downside is that we will be re-enabling an enabled mouse
	which *may* re-initialize the mouse (I'm not sure), but I think that's
	okay.
