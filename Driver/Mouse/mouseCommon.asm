MODULE:		MOUSE DRIVER -- Common code
FILE:		mouse.asm

AUTHOR:		Adam de Boor, March 24, 1989

ROUTINES:
	Name			Description
	----			-----------
	DriverStrategy		Driver strategy routine

	routines internal to driver:

	MouseInit		Initialize the driver
	MouseExit		Deinitialize the driver
	MouseSetRate		Set the mouse reporting rate.
	MouseGetRates		Return table of available report rates.
	MouseSendEvents		Accepts mouse change and sends events
	MouseGetAcceleration	Fetches current mouse acceleration factors
	MouseSetAcceleration	Allows setting of mouse acceleration

	routines required of device-specific code:

	MouseDevExit		Deinitialize the device.
	mouseRates		byte-table of available report rates, in
				ascending order. Should end with 255 so
				ridiculously high report rates can be handled.
				Such a thing should be interpreted as
				"continuous", probably.
	MOUSE_NUM_RATES		length of same.
	MouseDevSetRate		Set the report rate for the mouse. CX contains
				the index into mouseRates of the rate to use.

	MouseTestDevice		See if the requested device is present.

	MouseSetDevice		Configure driver to support the indicated
				device. MouseTestDevice will have been called,
				so MouseSetDevice can assume the device is
				present.

	MouseExtendedInfo	Resource containing a DriverExtendedInfoTable
				for the driver.

	configuration constants that control how code is compiled:

	MOUSE_CANT_SET_RATE	If defined, MouseSetRate will return an
				error, so MouseDevSetRate needn't be defined.
	MOUSE_DONT_ACCELERATE	If defined, MouseSendEvents will not apply
				acceleration to the mouse deltas.
	MOUSE_SEPARATE_INIT	If defined, driver has a separate Init resource
				into which MouseInit can be put.
	MOUSE_USES_ABSOLUTE_DELTAS
				If defined, inverts sense of EC code in
				MouseCombineEvent, makes MouseSendEvents
				assume pointer position always passed.
	MOUSE_COMBINE_DISCARD	If defined,causes MouseCombineEvent to just
				discard any new event if a IM_PTR_CHANGE event
				is already in the IM's queue.
	MOUSE_CANT_TEST_DEVICE	If defined, this file will define a trivial
				MouseTestDevice that tells the caller the
				driver is unable to determine if the device
				is present.

	MOUSE_CAN_BE_CALIBRATED	If defined, this file will not define the
				trivial calibration stubs, and instead will
				allow the specific driver to define those
				functions:
					MouseGetCalibrationPoints
					MouseSetCalibrationPoints
					MouseGetRawCoordinate

	MOUSE_PTR_FLAGS		PtrFlags that mouse driver wants to
				set when starting up.

	MOUSE_SUPPORT_MOUSE_COORD_BUFFER
				If defined, driver supports escape functions
				to return mouse co-ordinates in a buffer.
				Driver must include (using DefFarEscape) the
				common routines provided here in its own
				escape table.

	MOUSE_STORE_FAKE_MOUSE_COORDS
				If defined, the driver stores fake mouse
				coords in the coord buffer and sends off
				a MSG_IM_READ_DIGITIZER_COORDS after each
				fake coord is stored. This depends on
				MOUSE_SUPPORT_MOUSE_COORD_BUFFER also being
				defined. This is useful if you want to use
				the GenMouse driver to simulate collecting
				the mouse coords on a PC demo.
				You may also want to modify
				Kernel/IM/imPen.asm::StoreDigitizerCoords
				to convert the fake coords into simulated
				digitizer coords based on the current
				pointer screen position.

DESCRIPTION:
	Boiler-plate code for all mouse drivers. The idea here is to provide
	the interface to the system via the functions in this file. Each
	specific type of mouse will have its own device-dependent file
	that initializes, turns off and reads the state changes for that
	device. State changes are communicated to the system via the
	MouseSendEvents function.

	The device-dependent file includes this one.

%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Store mouse coordinates in circular buffer

CALLED BY:	(EXTERNAL) Device handler
PASS:		ds	= dgroup
		cx, dx	= current mouse coordinates
		bh	= zero if pen-down or pen-move, non-zero if pen-up
RETURN:		interrupt possibly ON
DESTROYED:	nothing
SIDE EFFECTS:	MSG_IM_READ_DIGITIZER_COORDS is sent as appropriate

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	This routine is non-reentrant.  Even if it is, invoking it
	recursively means it may be recording the points in the wrong order,
	and the IM will think the pen is moving backward for that few points.
	Hence, this routine should be called before IC_GENEOI is sent.

	NOTE:	If the event is pen-down or pen-move, this interrupt handler
		should call this routine AFTER calling MouseSendEvents.  If
		the event is pen-up, the handler should call this routine
		BEFORE MouseSendEvents.

	(For the pen-down/move and buffer not full case (most frequent case),
	optimize for speed because this is interrupt code.  For other cases,
	optimize for size because this is in fixed resource.)
