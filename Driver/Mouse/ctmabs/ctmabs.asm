ROUTINES:
	Name			Description
	----			-----------
	MouseDevInit		Intialize the device, registering a handler
				with the DOS Mouse driver
	MouseDevExit		Deinitialize the device, nuking our handler.
	MouseDevHandler		Handler for DOS driver to call.


REVISION HISTORY:

	Adam	7/20/89		Initial revision
	MeyerK	09/2021		add Mouse Wheel support via CuteMouse Wheel API


DESCRIPTION:
	Generic mouse driver that sits on top of the standard DOS one,
	using the absolute coordinates provided by the driver, rather than
	being relative as the other generic mouse driver is.
