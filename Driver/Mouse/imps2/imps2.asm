COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

PROJECT:  PC GEOS
MODULE:   Mouse Drivers - IntelliMouse-style PS/2 3-button wheel mice
FILE:     imps2.asm

DESCRIPTION:
	Device-dependent support for IntelliMouse PS2 mouse port. The PS2 BIOS
	defines a protocol that all mice connected to the port employ. Rather
	than interpreting it ourselves, we trust the BIOS to be efficient
	and just register a routine with it. Keeps the driver smaller and
	avoids problems with incompatibility etc.

SYNOPSIS:  HandleMem the receipt of an interrupt

CALLED BY:  	BIOS
PASS:    	ON STACK:
RETURN:    	Nothing
DESTROYED:  	Nothing

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	Overflow is ignored.

	For delta Y, positive => up, which is the opposite of what we think

KNOWN BUGS/SIDE EFFECTS/IDEAS:
	Some BIOSes rely on DS not being altered, while others do not.
	To err on the side of safety, we save everything we biff.
