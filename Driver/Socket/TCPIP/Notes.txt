Ed's notes on the TCPIP driver 6/00
-----------------------------------
There isn't any info on how this driver works anywhere, so what little
bits I figure out I'm going to write down here.

- All info on the link is stored in the LinkControlBlock (LCB)
- First entry in the LCB is the loopback connection, used for the ip 127.0.0.1
- Second entry is the main connection, referenced by MAIN_LINK_DOMAIN_HANDLE
- While there theoretically can be additional link drivers registered,
  I don't see any way this can happen. Also, a lot of the code assumes there
  is a main link driver, so even if an additional one was loaded, it wouldn't
  be used much (if at all).
- The only connection setting the TCPIP driver keeps track of is the local IP.
  That means it has no concept of routing. The link driver must handle that.
- The driver gets its idea of the local IP address from the link driver.
  TCPIP tells the link driver to open a connection, and then when the
  connection is open, the link driver calls the TCPIP driver informing it
  the connection was established. The TCPIP driver then queries the link
  driver for the IP address and MTU. TCPIP then wakes any clients waiting
  for the connection to open.
- Accessing the LCB requires getting exclusive access to the LCB
  (LinkTableGetEntry). Since the access must be exclusive, keep it locked
  as short a time as possible, as a large number (probably almost all) of the
  TCPIP functions require accessing the LCB at some point.
- TCP Congestion RFC says that TCP packet acknowledgement should be delayed
  up to 1/2 second, or until a second packet comes in, whichever comes first.
  Old code used to always delay 1/2 second, which was fast enough for 56k
  connections, but not not for anything faster. New code works like the RFC
  says. No performance difference on PPP, but enables ethernet to go as fast
  as we're able to process the data.

DHCP Implementation Plan
------------------------
The problem is DHCP needs to be called after the link is opened, but before
the semaphore is released. The problem posed here is that a socket send cannot
occur until the semaphore is released.

- Create a global variable for storing a thread handle. Ensure it is 0 when
  not attempting to gain an IP.
- Socket sending (and receiving if it ends up being necessary) will first
  check this variable to see if the stored thread handle matches the handle
  of the current thread before attempting to gain any locks. If they match,
  the code will jump past the attempt to gain the lock, and allow the
  operation to proceed. Otherwise, the code will proceed to attempt to gain
  the lock as usual.
- DHCP will be implemented inside the TCPIP driver. The code will be stored
  in its own movable resource so as not to use more heap space.
- Some info on DHCP will be stored by the TCP stack. Stored data includes:
  session cookie, DHCP server ip, time remaining until the different stages
  of lease renewal, and timer handle of renew timer.
- A timer goes off every 15 min to handle DHCP lease renewal. It simply
  subtracts 15 min from the remaining time. If the remaining time drops below
  15 min, it sets a timer to go off tn time for the next renewal phase.
  When this timer goes off, a new thread will be created to handle the renew.
- No errors are reported via the TCPIP stack, however, GCN notifications are
  sent out of DHCP progress. This means an app can be written to display
  error messages appropriately (such as the ipconfig app).

Current Problems with DHCP
--------------------------
- If the user specifies DNS servers in the access point, and the DHCP server
  returns the same DNS servers, the resolver will end up with duplicate
  entries and will probably query the same server twice.
- Lease renewal code not tested due to 3 day lease time here. If it needs to
  be disabled, just search for TimerStartSetOwner and comment it out.
- Space is left in the DHCP GCN notification for domain name, but currently
  it isn't queried for, since the resolver doesn't support it.
- On a related note, support needs to be added to the access point library
  for the local domain name. If a DNS lookup fails, the resolver should append
  the domain name to the host name and try again.
