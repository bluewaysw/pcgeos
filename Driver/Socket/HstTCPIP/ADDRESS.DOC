This document is an attempt to clarify the structure of addresses returned
by the TCP/IP address controller.  These are unresolved addresses.  Resolved 
addresses have the same format with the exception that the IP address 
has been converted to the 4 byte binary form.

LinkParams are optional and are only included if a link address exists.
They begin immediately after the link size and are followed by the connection
address.


Example 1.

	IP address: 123.78.209.45
	Link address: 	none

	ExtendedSACAddress <
		0,			; ESACA_linkSize
		"123.78.209.45">	; at ESACA_opaque

Example 2.

	IP address: foo@glorp.com
	Link address: 123-4567

	ExtendedSACAddress <
		9,			; ESACA_linkSize
		LT_ADDR,		; LinkParams: LP_type at ESACA_opaque
		"123-4567",		; LinkParams: LP_params
		"foo@glorp.com">	; at ESACA_opaque + ESACA_linkSize

Example 3.

	IP address: beep@honk.com
	Link address: access point ID #4
	
	ExtendedSACAddress <
		3,			; ESACA_linkSize
		LT_ID,			; ESACA_opaque.LP_type 
		4,			; ESACA_opaque.LP_params (word)
		"beep@honk.com">	; at ESACA_opaque + ESACA_linkSize

Example 4. (not a normal case... probably should never happen)

	IP address: none
	Link address: 123-45-6789

	ExtendedSACAddress <
		12,			; ESACA_linkSize
		LT_ADDR,		; ESACA_opaque.LP_type
		"123-45-6789">		; ESACA_opaque.LP_params


Example 5:

	IP addrss: gleep@frap.com
	Link address: none

	ExtendedSACAddress <
		0,			; ESACA_linkSize
		"gleep@frap.com">	; ESACA_opaque
