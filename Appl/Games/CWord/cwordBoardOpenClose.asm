SYNOPSIS:	When the application is first launched, the Quick Tips
                dialog is normally automatically initiated.  That dialog
                contains a Boolean that the user may check to prevent this
                from happening.

CALLED BY:	CwordOpenApplication

PASS:		ds - object block segment

RETURN:		carry set if dialog should not be initiated.

DESTROYED:

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:

                set the Boolean's state to reflect
                only return with carry set if setting is found and TRUE
