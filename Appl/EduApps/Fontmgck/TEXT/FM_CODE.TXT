Hi John,

if I remember correctly, Frank named you as the one keeping all the source code 
of Breadbox products together... and as it looks as if FM 1.0 is really finished 
now, I have attached a complete source code archive to this mail, 
hopefully including all the necessary tools and auxiliary files.

A few notes...

 - The GSOL archive is only a preliminary version because I plan to release this 
library as free product with documentation and samples in a short while, to try 
and set a standard for GString creator identification. (I will still have to ask 
Frank, but I don't think that he will have any objections to this...)

 - The PMVG.EXE utility converts the user interface description in the 
FONTM_UI.PVG file to GOC source code - the reason why his is necessary is that 
I used a folding editor named AE ("Andy's Editor") to create the UI tree...

 - Probably the best candidate for reuse is the CHARSET module implementing the 
floating character table. It should be fairly painless to transfer to another 
application because it sends all its data to the default focus, which means that 
it will work with any object accepting keypresses.
