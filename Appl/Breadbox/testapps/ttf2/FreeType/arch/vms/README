This directory contains two files for compiling the FreeType library under
VMS:

  ft_conf.h     the configuration file for the FreeType library
  descrip.mms   a makefile to be used with either MMS or MMK

The files are such designed that after unpacking of freetype-1.2 one can
give the command

  MMS/DESCR=[.LIB.ARCH.VMS]

to build the libraries. (Of course, for MMK use `MMK' on the command line
instead of `MMS'.) The makefile contains a `clean' target, but no `install'
target since I'm note sure where to install the library and the include
files.

I did NOT do the test programs but I tested it with my own programs.
