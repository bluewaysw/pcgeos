        Browser changes

        - default font size changed to 14 point, since that looks
          to be about the right size in GEOS
        - added kerning (space between characters) when using
          URW_SANS, to improve appearance of text
        - fixed font mapping code to reflect fact

        Remaining problems:
        - if you specify FACE=font1,font2,font3,..., the code will
          work fine, but if you put any whitespace between the
          font names, the parser does the wrong thing and fonts
          after the first one will be ignored. I decided to leave

- keep imported graphic as bitmap instead of converting
  to graphics string, reduces VM file usage/thrashing at
  the cost of some VM file size (can be turned off from
  .ini file)
- add .ini option to leave imported JPEGs uncompressed,
  saving some processing time at the cost of VM file
  space (default is to compress)
- if compressing, default is to compress per-scanline,
  which takes more processing, possible overflowing idle
  time during downloading, can be turned off using .ini
  option, which will cause compression to occur after
  entire graphic is downloaded and imported
- if using per-scanline compression, default is to use
  LZG compression, which takes more processing, but results
  in smaller imported graphics (and VM file usage), if turned
  off via .ini option, per-scanline compression uses RLE,
  which is faster but doesn't compress as well as LZG
