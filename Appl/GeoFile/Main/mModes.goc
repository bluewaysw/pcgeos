DESCRIPTION:	Set the application's UI according to the current user
		level features, application mode, document, etc.

PASS: 		ModeType	*appMode	= Current application mode.
						  MT_CURRENT will cause the
						  routine to query for the
						  current application mode.
						  The current Mode (it may
						  have changed) is stored
						  here in this routine.
		optr		modeGroup	= Mode list object to set
						  based on given mode.
						  NULL means don't do
						  anything to it.
		optr		layoutGroup	= Layout list object to set
						  based on given layout type.
						  NULL means don't do
						  anything to it.
		LayoutType	*layoutType	= Current layout mode type.
						  LT_NO_LAYOUT_TYPE will
						  cause the routine to
						  query for the value.
						  The current layout type (it 
						  may have changed) is stored
						  here in this routine.
		GeoFileLevelsFeatures	userFeatures
						= User Interface features
						  to base UI settings on.
						  Zero causes the function
						  to query for the value.
		UIInterfaceLevel	userLevel
						= User Interface level to
						  base UI settings on.
						  Zero causes the function
						  to query for the value.
RETURN:		Void.

SIDE EFFECTS:
	Requires:	uiTable appropriately initialized.

	Asserts:	GeoFile's UI is set in a manner consistent with the
			given arguments and the table entries.

CHECKS:
	Validates appMode.
	Checks for various pernicious cases of nonsensical/conflicting UI
	change data table entry fields.


PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	Mark the application busy and hold up input.
	If the UI features are not given then
		Query the database for the current UI features.
	If the UI Level is not given then
		Query the database for the current UI level.
	If the UI Level is Introductory then
		Set the application mode to Data Entry mode.
	Otherwise, if application mode is *not* given then
		Query the database for the current mode.
	If the application mode list argument exists then
		Force the mode list to the current application mode.
	If the layout mode type is *not* given then
		Query the database for the current layout mode type.
	For all entries in the application's UI change data table
		Check the table entry against the current application:
			Data-Entry/Design Mode, UI Interface Level, and
			UI Features to determine if the object from the
			table should be set USABLE or NOT_USABLE.
		If the layout field is non-zero and the current application
		mode is Design then
			Check the current application layout mode against
			the table value to determine whether or not the
			object from the table should be ENABLED or not.
		(See below for more information.)
	Set up the various controllers based on the current application
	mode.
	Resume input and show that application as being interactible.

KNOWN DEFECTS/CAVEATS/IDEAS:
	The table entries are utilized thusly:
		The 'features' field specifies which features (if any) that
		the given object is tied to (use GFLF_NO_FEATURES to
		specify that the object is *not* tied to any user interface
		level feature). I.e., if the feature is on then the object
		is made usable otherwise it's disabled.

		The 'levels' field specifies which user interface level(s)
		where the given object will be activated (absence obviously
		specifying non-usability). Note that the levels are
		independent in that an object could be only made usable at,
		say, Beginner and Guru levels but on none of the others.

		The 'modes' field specifies the application mode(s) in
		which the given object is to be activated.

		The 'layouts' field specifies (iff non-zero) the layout
		types in which the given object should be enabled/disabled
		*when in Design mode*. If the field is zero then nothing is
		changed.

	So, the major items are nuked or not depending on user level,
	current document, user invoked mode change to provide a large
	difference in the action/look-n-feel/etc. of the application while
	the various objects associated with the different layout types are
	merely grayed out or not to highlight the fact that there are only
	some relatively minor differences between Design mode layout types.

	Note that the objects specified in the above UI changes table
	('uiTable') are restricted in their user level behavior in that
	they can only be set usable/not-usable and/or enabled/not-enabled
	as opposed to the various things that can be done in the user
	interface levels tables but since those tables can't be extended to
	contain more data fields...  Anyways, keep that in mind along with
	the fact that things like controllers that need to be updated
	(GAUC_RECALC and it's ilk) based on the current level should be
	appropriately placed in the UI levels tables for that functionality
	(they may still need to be in the uiTable however).  Hope that's
	not too confusing. :-)

DESCRIPTION:	Handle the user initiated switching between the Data Entry
		and Design modes (or vice versa).

PASS: 		word	selection	= MT_DATA_ENTRY or MT_DESIGN
		word	numSelections	= ??? (1).
		word	stateFlags	= ???.

RETURN:		Void.

SIDE EFFECTS:
	Requires:	???

	Asserts:	???

CHECKS:			None.

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	Get the current mode list selection.
	If Design mode then
		Commit the current data entry record if any.
		Instruct the database to enter design mode.
	Otherwise,
		Instruct the database to enter data entry mode.
	Set the user interface to a state consistent with the selected
	mode.

KNOWN DEFECTS/CAVEATS/IDEAS:	???
