ROUTINES:
	Name			Description
	----			-----------
	REDCreatePatchFile	Create a new executable, and then generate a 
				patch file by comparing it to the original 
				file. 
	REDCreateExecutable	Creates a new geode from the document's 
				translation file and the original source geode. 
	REDCreateNullExecutable	Build a null geode and a language patch file 
				with respect to it. 
	REDValidate		Check the document to make sure string 
				arguments match and no strings are outside size 
				limits. 
	CheckChunks		Enumerate the elements in this ResourceArray, 
				checking for min/max or string argument 
				violations. 
	CheckChunksCallback	Check that each text chunk which has 1 or 2 
				string args in the original has the same number 
				in the translation. Check also that the min/max 
				length constraints are not violated. 
	CheckItemForLength	Check that the translation item does not 
				violate the min/max length contsraints. 
	CheckItemForStringArgs	Make sure translation item has proper number of 
				string args. 
	WriteResource		The resource has been updated, now write it to 
				file. 
	WriteRelocationTable	The updated resource has been written to the 
				file, now write the relocation table out. Free 
				it when done. 
	UpdateResourceTable	The resource has been updated, now set its new 
				size and position in the resource table. Also 
				read its relocation table into memory. 
	UpdateResource		Update any chunks that have changed, compact 
				the heap, fix the LMemBlockHeader. 
	UpdateChunk		Change the data in the chunk for this element 
				to the data stored in the TransItem. 
	NullStringsInChunk	If this chunk holds textual data, replace it 
				with a null string. 
	LocInitEndOfChunk	Initialize the end of a used chunk to 0xcc. 
	UpdateObjectChunk	This object has a keyboard shortcut which may 
				need updating. 
	UpdateChunkFixMonikerWidth	Data has been copied out to chunk. 
				Fix-up moniker's cached width, if necessary. 
	UpdateChunkCopyData	Copy the translated item to the resized chunk. 
	VerifyChunkEquality	Make sure that chunk in geode is same as 
				original chunk stored in the translation file, 
				to ensure that the translation file is not out 
				of sync with the geode. 
	CopyResourceTable	Make a copy of the resource table that will not 
				be modified in the process of building the new 
				executable. 
	CopyHeaders		Copy the headers from the source to destination 
				geode. 
	OpenBuildFiles		Open the source geode and a new file in the 
				destination path for the new geode. 
	ChangeNameAndUserNotes	Change the longname and user notes in the newly 
				created file. 
	DeleteNewGeode		The build failed. Delete the new geode file, if 
				one was created. 
	CloseBuildFiles		The CreateExecutable function is done, so close 
				the files now.

SYNOPSIS:       Find the chunk in the original, unedited resource
		which contains the offset in this GeodeRelocationEntry.

CALLED BY:      (INTERNAL) UpdateRelocationTable

PASS:           es:si   - GeodeRelocationEntry
                ^hbx    - original resource block
                ^hdx    - new resource block

RETURN:		carry set if chunk containing relocation was not found 
		carry clear if relocation was found
                ^ldi - chunk handle containing this relocation
	         bp = relative offset of the relocation within the chunk
		    = 0 if relocation did not change becuase its offset
		      is before the handle table, and therefore was not
		      affected by any changes to chunks in the resource.

DESTROYED:      nothing

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	Lock the original resource.  
	Look through the handle table for the last entry whose value
		is greater than the relocation offset.

	The Translation libraries use DefTransLib macro to create a
	FormatStrings resource, which contains the following structure.

	Only the strings are actual chunks.  The optrs have relocation
	entries, but their offset is before the first chunk handle, so
	do not change as a result of editing changes to the chunks.
