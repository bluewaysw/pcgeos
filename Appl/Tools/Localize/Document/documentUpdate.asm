	DocumentCommitUpdate	Reset translation file to not updated state 
				(clear all chunk state flags and remove the 
				"Deleted Chunks" resource. 
	ClearState		Clear ChunkState flags in this element. 
	DocumentUpdateTranslation	Creates the updated translation 
				database from new localization file and geode, 
				which is then merged with the existing 
				translation file for this document. 
	SetCommitTriggerState	Enables/Disables the CommitTrigger 
				appropriately. 
	MergeUpdateAndTrans	Enumerates all the elements in the new 
				ResourceMap, merging the updated translation 
				database into the existing one. 
	MergeResource		For the passed updated resource, looks for a 
				matching resource and matching elements in the 
				existing translation database. 
	FindUnmatchedElements	Enumerate an updated ResourceArray, looking for 
				elements which were not matched by a chunk in 
				the corresponding ResourceArray in the old 
				translation database. 
	FindUnmatchedElementsCallback	Enumerate this resource from the old 
				translation file, trying to find a match for 
				the passed ResourceArrayElement from the 
				updated database. 
	FindMatchingResource	Search by name for a matching resource in the 
				translation file for this updated resource. 
	FindMatchingElement	Look for an element in the passed translation 
				database ResourceArray which matches (name and 
				data) this element from the updated geode. 
	VerifyElementsMatch	Check if two elements, one from the translation 
				file and from the updated geode, contain the 
				same chunk. 
	CompareData		Compare the origItem from the old and new 
				elements to check for matches. 
	FindElementsInResource	Enumerate an updated ResourceArray's elements, 
				looking for matches in the passed translation 
				file's ResourceArray. 
	FindElementsInResourceCallback	Look for a match for this element from 
				the updated ResourceArray in the translation 
				file's ResourceArray. 
	DeleteGeodeGroups	Free all DBGroups used by this ResourceMap. 
	FixChunkState		Any unmarked elements in this ResourceArray 
				from the new ResourceMap are chunks that have 
				been added to the geode since the translation 
				file was created or last updated. Set their 
				ChunkState to CS_ADDED. Clear the ChunkState of 
				CS_UNCHANGED chunks so that the filtering code 
				works properly. (Unchanged chunks are shown by 
				default.) 
	FinishUpdate		Mark all unmarked chunks as "new" (if in the 
				new ResourceMap) or "delete" (if in the old 
				ResourceMap). Copy the "deleted" chunks to a 
				new resource in the updated database, called 
				"Deleted_Chunks". 
	FinishUpdateCallback	Copy unmarked elements from old DB to new 
				"Deleted_Chunks" resource in updated DB. 
	ChunkCountCallback	Count the number of new, changed chunks in this 
				resource. 
	MoveDeletedChunks	Move unmarked chunks to Deleted_Chunks resource 
				in update. 
	MoveDeletedChunksCallback	No match was found for this chunk in 
				the updated database, so move it to the new 
				resource in the update created just for this 
				purpose. 
	DisplayChunkStateCounts	Report the results of the update to user. 
	BatchDisplayChunkStateCounts	Report the results of the change to the 
				user while in batch mode.
	SetUpdateState		Sets the update flag in the document and TMH. 
	MyCopyDBItem		Copy a DBItem, fixing up es or ds.

DESCRIPTION:

	Code for updating translation files with new localization information.

	The strategy here is to assume that all updates will be taking place
	on geodes that were parsed using localiation VM files, so that the
	resources and chunks have names (not just the generic Resource7 and
	Chunk5 type of names).  

	When the user starts the Update, the geode for that localization
	file will be opened and parsed into a ResourceMap/ResourceArray
	structure that is created in the translation file parallel to the
	original Map.  The new map will replace the old when when the update
	is completed.

	For every element in the new (updated) ResourceMapArray, look for a 
	element (resource) of the same name in the original map.

	    If not found, mark the resource as a "new".

	    For every element (chunk) in the updated resource's 
	    ResourceArray, look for a chunk of the same name 
	    in the original ResourceArray.

		If found, compare data in the new and old chunks.
		   If it is different, mark the chunk as "changed"
		   in both new and old ResourceArrays.  Copy the
		   translation item from the old to the new element.

		   If it is the same, mark it as unchanged in both.

		If not found, do a search through every ResourceArray in
		the old map for a chunk containing the same data.

		    If found, mark it as a match, copying the 
		    translation item from the original element to the 
		    new element.
		    
		    If not found, mark it as a new element.

	After the matching process is completed, any unmarked
	chunks in the old map are assumed not present in the updated
	map, and are marked for deletion.  Any unmarked chunks in the
	new map are assumed to be new chunks and are marked as such.
	The chunks marked for deletion are moved to a newly created
	resource in the updated map, called "Deleted Chunks".  Any
	empty resources are deleted.

	At this point, the new map contains all information from both 
	the old and the new versions of the geode, so the old ResourceMap 
	and its ResourceArrays are deleted and the new ResourceMap is set 
	as the MapItem for the translation file.
