DESCRIPTION:
	This sample application demonstrates the use of the GenView
	object. Full treatment of this object is located within
	Chapter 9 of the Objects book.

	The GenView object provides your application with a window to
	display data within. This data may be graphical or text, a
	generic object tree, or a visible object tree. The GenView
	allows a scrollable, sizable, and scalable window that can
	adjust the display of its data based on the View attributes. 

	The GenView sends out messages that define how your data is
	drawn. You must have an object to receive these messages; this
	object is known as the view's *content* object. The content
	object may be one of three different classes depending on what
	type of data you wish to display.

	If you are displaying just standard graphics, you will want
	the content to be a subclass of GenProcessClass. Your subclass
	should intercept MSG_META_EXPOSED and handle drawing the
	graphics within that handler. This is the model used in this
	sample application.

	If you are displaying a tree of Vis objects, you will need a
	VisContent to act as the View's content object. See the Vis
	sample apps for details on how to use this model.

	If you are displaying a tree of generic objects, you will 
	a GenContent object to act as the View's content object. This
	approach is the least common. See the View/GenContent sample
	app for a demonstration using this model.
