REVISION HISTORY:
	Name	Date		Description
	----	----		-----------
	JDM	92.10.05	Initial version.
	RainerB	4/27/2022	Some fixes for Watcom compatibility
				ATTR_GEN_TEXT_CHAR_ATTR added to FooText
				
DESCRIPTION:
	This application tests the C language use of the UI Levels
	mechanism.

	Also note that Zoomer is set at the introductory user level
	and does not allow user level changes, so this application
	does not function fully on Zoomer.
