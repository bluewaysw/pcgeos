The Universal Installer Tools
-----------------------------

The tools create or install "installation packages" with which programs and
other file collections can be conveniently distributed and installed. 
By considering the protocol and release numbers, it is guaranteed that newer
versions (e.g. of libraries) are not overwritten by older versions.

The original code was written in German. Therefore, most of the comments 
are still in German.
