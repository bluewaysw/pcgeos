Character Map
Version 1.1.0 2/22/97


  Description
  ===========
Character Map for GEOS is very much like the Microsoft Windows version.
It's purpose is to let you see all of the characters that GEOS supports
and select them for pasting into documents. The "map" is really just a
grid of all the characters from the space (0x20) to the last ASCII
character (0xFF). You can select characters and copy them to the clipboard.
From there you can paste them into other documents, such as GeoWrite or
Text File Editor. Not only that, but Character Map also shows you the key
sequence necessary to generate each character.


  Instructions
  ============
To use Character Map just double-click on its icon. Once it displays itself
on the screen you should see a grid of characters. They are drawn in a small
point size, so to make them easier to see I've allowed you to "magnify" a
single character at a time. To do this you can do one of two things: Press
the key for the character you want magnified, or click and hold the mouse
button on the character. The character will be shown at three times its
usual size. You can move the "magnifier" around by dragging the mouse or
using the cursor keys.

To select the "magnified" character and put it in the "Characters to copy"
text field, click on Select. You can also type in the "Characters to copy"
field if you want. When you have the characters you want to copy to the
clipboard, click on Copy. This will copy the characters in the "Characters
to copy" field to the clipboard. You can then paste the characters from
the clipboard into whatever GEOS application you like.

NEW: If you double click on a character in the map, it will be copied to the
"Characters to copy" field.

NEW: You can right-click the characters on the character map and drag them
to any other text field, including GeoWrite.
