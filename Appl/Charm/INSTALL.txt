Character Map - Installation Instructions
Version 1.1.0 2/22/97

Zoomer Users
============

For installing Character Map on the Zoomer, first, establish a connection
between a computer and the Zoomer. This is most likely done with a serial
cable and GEOS Ensemble running on the PC. Then load the Character Map files
onto the PC. You are now ready to start.

1. Connect the serial cable to your PC and Zoomer. Set up the Connect options
   under the Preferences of both PC/GEOS and the Zoomer.

2. Start GeoManager on your PC. Start File Manager on the Zoomer. Click on
   the "Connect" button in GeoManager. Select "File Linking" from the
   Connect menu in the Zoomer File Manager. The two machines should connect
   and you'll be ready to transfer the files.

3. Using GeoManager on the PC, open drive B of the Zoomer.

4. Change to the Geoworks\World directory. Your path should now read:

      B:[INTERNAL]\GEOWORKS\WORLD

5. Copy the following file to this directory:

      CHARM.GEO


This completes the installation of Character Map to your Zoomer.
Thank you and I hope you enjoy using Character Map!


OmniGo Users
============

For an OmniGo, follow these steps to install Character Map:

  To install Character Map to the OmniGo, you must get the Installer
program. You can get Installer from America Online, CompuServe, or the
Blue Marsh Softworks web site (http://members.aol.com/nfiedler/). Use
Installer to extract the CHARM.GPK file into the Character Map program,
and transfer it directly to the OmniGo. Here are the basic steps:

  1. Turn on your computer and OmniGo. Connect them using a serial cable.

  2. Run Transfer on the OmniGo, and select PC, then Connect. Start
     Installer on the PC, and select the appropriate COM port (the one
     the serial cable is plugged into).

  3. In Installer, select the drive and directory where CHARM.GPK is
     located (initially it is in the directory with these instructions),
     and select Install to install the program. The Character Map
     program will be copied over to the OmniGo.

  5. Exit Installer on the PC, and close Transfer on the OmniGo.

  6. Now you can run Character Map. It will be located on the Home Screen.


This completes the installation of Character Map to your OmniGo.
Thank you and I hope you enjoy using Character Map!
