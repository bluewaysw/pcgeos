SYNOPSIS:	Set dx to be one of two ToolAreaClass objects.  The IconArea
		object is placed at the bottom of the GeoManager Primary, and
		the FloatingDrivesDialog is a free floating dialog box.  This
		ToolAreaClass object is where the drive buttons will be placed
		as they are instantiated


		Drives buttons are built out to different places depending on 
		what filemanager we are using.  For the FileCabinet and Palm
		Connect, we want to always build them out to the IconArea, for
		Zoomer we want to build them out to the FloatingDrivesDialog
		(which, in Zoomer, is a child of the IconArea) and in
		GeoManager we want to build them to either of these two (in
		GeoManager the FloatingDrivesDialog is not a child of the
		IconArea, but a free floating dialog) depending on the Options.
