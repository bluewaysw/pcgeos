COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

METHOD:		DeskApplicationEnsureActiveFT

DESCRIPTION:	This message is subclassed because we want to make sure that
		when the Application object gets the focus/target it checks all
		window that its geode owns regardless of LayerID.  The normal
		superclass handler uses whatever already has the focus/target
		or checks within only the owning geode layer.  By doing this
		preliminary check, when we call the superclass the target is
		already set (by us) or (if we can't find one) does its normal
		routine, which then sets the focus appropriately because one
		place for the focus to default to is the target.

CALLED BY AS OF 2/22/92:
	see superclass handler (OLApplicationEnsureActiveFT)

PASS:		standard object stuff

RETURN:		Nothing
