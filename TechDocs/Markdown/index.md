## #FreeGEOS technical documentation

#FreeGEOS comes with extensive technical documentation that describes tools, programming languages and API calls from the perspective of an SDK user. This documentation can be found in the `TechDocs` folder and is available in Markdown format. Here are some entry points to the main volumes:

- Introduction
  - [Tutorial](tutorial.md) - the initial chapters describing the development environment are somewhat outdated, and still refer to the original two-machine setup for debugging, but this nevertheless gives a good idea of overall development process.
  - [Concepts](concepts.md)
  - [Tools](tools.md)
- C development
  - [GOC keywords and API calls](routines.md)
  - [Objects Reference](objects.md)
