The GEOS memory manager is well suited to dealing with blocks of memory in the 2K-6K range. However, for small amounts of memory, the manager's overhead becomes significant. For this reason, GEOS provides local memory (or <EM>
LMem</EM>
) routines. These routines let an application allocate a block of memory and designate it as a <EM>
local memory heap</EM>
. The application can then request small amounts of memory from this heap. The LMem library automatically reorganizes the heap when necessary to make space available.</P>
<P>
The local memory routines are also used to manipulate objects. All objects are special LMem chunks which are stored in a special type of LMem heap (called an <EM>
object block</EM>
). Most of the routines which work on chunks can also be used on objects.</P>

Design Philosophy</H2>
<P>
The GEOS memory manager is designed to deal with blocks of memory which are measured in kilobytes. Every memory block needs an entry in the global handle table; each such entry takes up 16 bytes. This memory overhead is insignificant for a 10K code block but very significant for, for example, a 100 byte database entry. Furthermore, GEOS allows a limited number of global handles. If an application were to use global blocks for small amounts of data, it could use up too many handles.</P>
<P>
On the other hand, if an application were to store many small pieces of data in a single global block, it might have to write elaborate memory-management routines. It would have to make sure that it could resize a piece of data at will and shuffle other data to make room. This could force programmers to spend a lot of their time writing support code.</P>
<P>
For these reasons, GEOS provides local memory routines. Applications can designate a block of memory as a local-memory heap and use LMem routines to request small amounts (<EM>
chunks</EM>
) of data. The local memory library automatically shuffles chunks in that heap to make room for new requests. Applications can change the size of a chunk at will. The cost of using the LMem routines is one added layer of indirection and a small amount of memory overhead for each chunk. </P>
<P>
The LMem routines have another advantage. They provide a uniform way of managing small pieces of memory. This lets GEOS add functionality which applications can use in a variety of ways. For example, GEOS implements an array-management scheme based on LMem chunks; this scheme comes complete with a modified Quicksort routine. Similarly, all GEOS objects are stored in object blocks, which are a special kind of local-memory heap. This makes it easy to add or delete objects dynamically.</P>

Structure of a Local Memory Heap</H2>

 </A>
A local memory heap looks and acts much like the global heap. However, it is contained entirely within a single memory block. This block is initialized with a 16-byte <CODE>
LMemBlockHeader</CODE>
 (described on <A HREF="#LMem_7.htm_53143"> The offset within the block where the local heap's handle table will begin. The local heap will fill the space to the end of the block; any data between the LMemBlockHeader and the indicated offset will be zero-initialized. If an application wil</A>
), a local memory handle table, and a local memory heap. Optionally, a space for data may be allocated between the header and the handle table.</P>
<P>
Each allocated section of memory within a local heap is called a <EM>
chunk</EM>
, and the handles of these chunks are called <EM>
chunk handles</EM>
. 
<P>
Chunks comprise a chunk of data preceded by a word that contains the length of the data (in bytes). When the heap is created, a certain number of chunk handles will be allocated. If a chunk is requested after all of these chunks have been given out, the local memory routines will enlarge the LMem handle table, relocating chunks as necessary. Unused chunks are stored in a linked list.</P>

The Local Heap</H3>
<P>
An application may designate any block as a local memory heap. The block may or may not be fixed, swapable, or discardable, as the application desires. </P>
<P>
A block may have other data besides the local heap. When a local heap is created, an offset into the block can be specified. The heap will put its header structure at the beginning of the block and the handle table at the specified offset; everything in between will be left untouched by the LMem routines. The offset must be larger than the standard header or else may be zero, indicating that the default offset should be used.
<IMG SRC="LMem_3_lmemHeap.gif">

</P>
<P>
Before performing any operations on a local memory heap, an application must lock the heap the way it would any other block. Some local memory routines may need to resize the block; this may cause the block to be moved on the global heap. Therefore, you should assume that these routines may invalidate all pointers to the relevant block. The descriptions of routines which may behave this way will contain a warning to that effect. When you initialize an LMem heap, you can specify that it should never be resized; this is advisable if the heap is in a fixed block.</P>
<P>
A virtual-memory file block may contain an LMem heap. For details on this, see <A HREF="../../Memory/VM/index.htm#83616">the Virtual Memory chapter</A>.</P><HR>

Chunks and Chunk Handles</H3>
<P>
Just as blocks on the local heap are accessed with handles, chunks are accessed via chunk handles.<A NAME="LMem_4.htm_IX_Chunk handles">
 </A>
 Each chunk handle is an offset into the block containing the local memory heap; thus, the segment address of the locked heap, combined with the chunk handle, make up a pointer to a location within the local memory heap's chunk handle table. That location contains another offset which, when combined with the segment address of the block, composes a far-pointer to the actual chunk. </P>
<P>
Chunks are movable within the local heap; whenever a chunk is created or resized, the local memory manager may move any chunks in that heap. There is no locking mechanism for chunks; thus, creating or resizing a chunk can potentially invalidate pointers to all the other chunks, forcing the application to again dereference the handles for these chunks. Be warned that many message handlers can cause heap compaction. As a general rule, you should not save chunk addresses around message sends; instead, dereference the chunk handles to get the current address.
<IMG SRC="LMem_4_referencing.gif">

</P>
<P>
Chunks are aligned along dwords. This speeds up chunk moves and similar operations. This means that when you request a chunk, its size may be slightly larger than you request.</P>
<P>
Objects are special kinds of LMem chunks. An optr is simply the global memory handle of an LMem heap followed by the chunk handle of an object. For this reason, many LMem routines come in two formats: one which is passed an optr, and one which is passed the global and chunk handles. There is also a macro, <CODE>
ConstructOptr()</CODE>
, which is passed a memory handle and a chunk handle and returns an optr constructed from the two.

In addition to being used for general memory needs, local memory heaps perform many specific functions in the GEOS system. When an LMem heap is created, a member of the <CODE>
LMemType</CODE>
 enumerated type is passed, indicating to what use the LMem heap will be put. Several types are available:</P>
<DL>
<DT>
LMEM_TYPE_GENERAL</DT><DD>
The LMem heap will be used for general data storage, possibly including a chunk, name, or element array. When an application creates an LMem heap, it will almost always be of type &quot;General&quot; or &quot;Object.&quot;</DD>
<DT>
LMEM_TYPE_WINDOW</DT><DD>
Windows are stored in memory as LMem heaps. The header contains information about the window; each region in the window is stored as a chunk. Applications will not directly create Window heaps.</DD>
<DT>
LMEM_TYPE_OBJ_BLOCK</DT><DD>
Objects are stored in object blocks, which are LMem heaps. An object block has some extra header information and contains one chunk which contains only flags. All the objects in the block are stored as chunks on the heap. Applications can directly create object blocks; for more information, see <A HREF="../../Programming/GOCLanguage/index.htm">the GEOS Programming chapter</A>.</DT><P CLASS="WorList">
LMEM_TYPE_GSTATE<BR>
A GState is an LMem heap. The GState information is in the header, and the application clip-rectangle is stored in a chunk. Applications do not directly create GState blocks; rather, they call a GState creation routine, which creates the block. (See <A HREF="../../Graphics/Environment/index.htm">the Graphics Environment chapter</A>.)</P><DT>
LMEM_TYPE_FONT_BLOCK<BR>
Font blocks are stored as LMem heaps. Applications do not create font blocks directly.</DD>
<DT>
LMEM_TYPE_GSTRING</DT><DD>
Whenever a GString is created or loaded, a GString LMem heap is created, and elements are added as chunks. The heap is created automatically by the GString routines; applications should not create GString blocks. (See <A HREF="../../Graphics/Environment/Environment_12.htm#16169">the Graphics Environment chapter</A>.)</DT><P CLASS="WorList">
LMEM_TYPE_DB_ITEMS<BR>
The Virtual Memory mechanism provides routines to create and manage <EM>
database items</EM>
</DL>
, short pieces of data which are dynamically allocated and are saved with the VM file. These items are stored in special database LMem heaps, which are created in special database blocks in the VM file. Applications do not directly allocate DB blocks; rather, they call DB routines, which see to it that the blocks are created.

 </A>
<A NAME="LMem_5.htm_60651">
 </A>
When an LMem heap is allocated, certain flags are passed to indicate properties the heap should have. Some of these flags are passed only for system-created heaps. The flags are stored in a word-length record (<CODE>
LocalMemoryFlags</CODE>
); the record also contains flags indicating the current state of the heap. The <CODE>
LocalMemoryFlags</CODE>
 are listed below:</P>
<DL>
<DT>
LMF_HAS_FLAGS<BR>
Set if the block has a chunk containing only flags. This flag is set for object blocks; it is usually cleared for general LMem heaps.</DD>
<DT>
LMF_IN_RESOURCE</DT><DD>
Set if the block has just been loaded from a resource and has not been changed since being loaded. This flag is set only for object blocks created by the compiler.</DD>
<DT>
LMF_DETACHABLE</DT><DD>
Set if the block is an object block which can be saved to a state file.</DD>
<DT>
LMF_DUPLICATED</DT><DD>
Set if block is an object block created by the <CODE>
ObjDuplicateResource()</CODE>
 routine. This flag should not be set by applications.</DD>
<DT>
LMF_RELOCATED</DT><DD>
Set if all the objects in the block have been relocated. The object system sets this when it has relocated all the objects in the block. </DD>
<DT>
LMF_AUTO_FREE</DT><DD>
This flag is used by several object routines. It indicates that if the block's in-use count drops to zero, the block may be freed. This flag should not be set by applications.</DD>
<DT>
LMF_IN_MEM_ALLOC</DT><DD>
This flag is used in error-checking code to prevent the heap from being validated while a chunk is being allocated. For internal use only--do not modify<EM>
.</EM>
</DD>
<DT>
LMF_IS_VM</DT><DD>
Set if LMem heap is in a VM block and the block should be marked dirty whenever a chunk is marked dirty. This flag is automatically set by the VM code when an LMem heap is created in or attached to a VM file. This flag should not be set by applications.</DD>
<DT>
LMF_NO_HANDLES</DT><DD>
Set if block does not use chunk handles. A block can be set to simulate the C <CODE>
malloc() </CODE>
routine; in this case, chunks are not relocated after being created, so chunk handles are not needed. Ordinarily, these blocks are created by the <CODE>
malloc()</CODE>
 routine, not by applications. (See the discussion of <CODE>
malloc()</CODE>
 in <A HREF="../../Memory/Heap/Memory_e.htm">the Memory Management chapter</A>.)</DT><P CLASS="WorList">
LMF_NO_ENLARGE<BR>
Indicates that the local-memory routines should not enlarge this block to fulfill chunk requests. This guarantees that the block will not be moved by a chunk allocation request; however, it makes these requests more likely to fail.</P>
<DT>
LMF_RETURN_ERRORS<BR>
Set if local memory routines should return errors when allocation requests cannot be fulfilled. If the flag is not set, allocation routines will fatal-error if they cannot comply with requests. This flag is generally clear for expandable LMem blocks, since many system routines (such as <CODE>
ObjInstantiate()</CODE>
) are optimized in such a way that they cannot deal with LMem allocation errors.</DD>
<DT>
LMF_DEATH_COUNT</DT><DD>
This field occupies the least significant three bits of the flag field. It means nothing if the value is zero. If it is non-zero, it indicates the number of remove-block messages left which must hit <CODE>
BlockDeathCommon</CODE>
 before it will free the block. This flag is used some error-checking code in the kernel.</DD>
<DT>
STD_LMEM_OBJECT_FLAGS</DT><DD>
This is a constant which combines the LMF_HAS_FLAGS and LMF_RELOCATED flags. These flags should be set for all object blocks.</DD>

Local memory heaps are much like the global heap and are accessed in much the same way. Local heaps are simple to create and manage.</P>

Many applications will not need to use local heaps directly; instead, they will use more advanced data-management mechanisms based on local heaps, such as chunk arrays or database blocks. However, even if you use these mechanisms, you should be familiar with this section; this will help you understand how the other mechanisms work.</P>

Creating a Local Heap</H3>
<PRE>LMemInitHeap(), MemAllocLMem()</PRE>
<P>
Before you create a local heap, you must first allocate and lock a block on the global heap using <CODE>
MemAlloc()</CODE>
 and <CODE>
MemLock()</CODE>
. (Alternatively, you can allocate a fixed block.) Then, you must call <CODE>
LMemInitHeap()</CODE>
. (If you are creating a local heap to hold objects, you should use the <CODE>

<P>
<CODE>
LMemInitHeap()</CODE>
<A NAME="LMem_7.htm_IX_LMemInitHeap()">

<UL>
<LI>
The handle of a locked or fixed block which will contain the local memory heap. It may be moveable, discardable, both, or neither; it should <EM>
not</EM>
 have the flag HF_LMEM set. If the LMem heap will be resizable, the block may be of any size; the LMem routines will enlarge it if necessary. If the heap will not be resizable (i.e. LMF_NO_ENLARGE is passed), it must be created large enough to accommodate the heap.</LI>
<LI>
<A NAME="LMem_7.htm_53143">
 </A>
The offset within the block where the local heap's handle table will begin. The local heap will fill the space to the end of the block; any data between the <CODE>
LMemBlockHeader</CODE>
 and the indicated offset will be zero-initialized. If an application will not need a fixed data space, it should specify an offset of zero; the handle table will then be put immediately after the <CODE>
LMemBlockHeader</CODE>
. If the created block will be an object block, then it will need room for an <CODE>
ObjLMemBlockHeader</CODE>
 structure. Often, when an application needs a fixed data space, it will define a special structure, the first element of which is an <CODE>
LMemBlockHeader</CODE>

LMemInitHeap()</CODE>

A word specifying the number of chunk handles to leave room for in the starter handle table. When these chunks have all been allocated, the local memory manager will expand the LMem handle table to create more chunk handles. No matter how big the starter handle table is, the heap will initially contain just one chunk (whose size is specified by the next argument). Applications should generally pass the constant STD_INIT_HANDLES.</LI>
<LI>
A word specifying the amount of space to be assigned to the chunk created when the heap is initialized. When more space is needed, the chunks will expand to the end of the block, and (if necessary) the block itself will be expanded. Applications should generally pass the constant STD_INIT_HEAP.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<CODE>
LMemInitHeap()</CODE>
 creates the <CODE>
LMemBlockHeader</CODE>
 and the chunk handle table. It also creates a single free chunk; more chunks will automatically be created as needed. It may resize the block passed (unless the flag LMF_NO_ENLARGE is passed); therefore, any pointers to the block may become invalid. It does not return anything.</P>

MemAllocLMem()</CODE>
 allocates a movable, swapable block in the global heap, then initializes an LMem heap in that block. If you specify an <CODE>

 allocates a new chunk on the local heap. It is passed the handle of the block containing the heap and the size of the chunk needed. <CODE>
LMemAlloc()</CODE>
 returns the handle of the new chunk (which must then be dereferenced before the chunk is used). The size requested will be rounded up as necessary to ensure that the chunks are dword-aligned. An additional two bytes will be allocated to store the size of the chunk; these bytes will be before the data. This routine may compact the chunks on the local heap, so all pointers to that heap will be invalidated; they will have to be dereferenced by their chunk handles. Furthermore, the block itself may be moved (if LMF_NO_ENLARGE is not set). Even fixed blocks may be moved if they need to expand to accommodate new chunks.</P>
<P>
All of the following routines come in two forms. As noted, an optr is simply the handle of an object block, followed by the object's chunk handle. For this reason, most LMem routines come in two slightly different formats: one where the chunk is specified with an optr, and one where it is specified with the two handles. In all other ways, the two versions of each routine are identical. Indeed, in assembly there is only a single version of each routine; the only difference is in how the C routines take their parameters.</P>

<A NAME="LMem_8.htm_IX_LMemDerefHandles()">

<A NAME="LMem_8.htm_IX_LMemDeref()">

Once you have allocated a chunk, you must dereference its chunk handle in order to use it. You can do this with <CODE>
LMemDeref()</CODE>
. This routine takes a singe parameter, namely the optr. It returns a pointer to the data portion of the chunk (after the size word). This pointer will remain valid until the block is unlocked or until a routine is called which can cause block resizing or heap compaction (e.g. <CODE>
LMemAlloc()</CODE>
). Since these routines can invalidate chunk-pointers, it is important that data-synchronization routines be used if more than one thread is accessing the heap; otherwise, one thread may cause the heap to be shuffled while another thread is trying to read from it.

The new bytes will not be zero-initialized. If the new chunk size is smaller than the old one, the chunk will be truncated; pointers to chunks will not be invalidated.

Most of these techniques are described in their own chapters.

Chunk Arrays</H3>

Very often an application will need to keep track of many different pieces of data and access them by an index. An application can do this in the traditional way, i.e., allocate a block of memory and set it up as an array. However, GEOS provides a mechanism which is often more suitable: the <EM>
chunk array</EM>
. The chunk array routines let you dynamically insert or delete elements in the middle of an array; you can get a pointer to an arbitrary element (specified by its index number); you can sort the array based on any arbitrary criterion. The array can be specified as &quot;uniform-size&quot; (all elements the same size, specified when the chunk array is created), or &quot;variable-size&quot; (each element can be created at an arbitrary size and can be resized at will). Note that either type of array can grow or shrink dynamically; while the elements may be of a fixed size, the array need not be.</P>
<P>
The chunk array is implemented on top of the LMem routines. The entire array is a single chunk in a local memory heap (hence the name). It therefore has a maximum total size of somewhat less than 64K, and memory efficiency drops significantly if it is larger than roughly 6K. If you need a larger array, you should use a Huge Array (see <A HREF="../../Memory/VM/VM_17.htm#43357">the VM chapter</A>). If you will be using the chunk array routines, you should include <STRONG CLASS="fileName">chunkarr.h</STRONG>
.</P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Structure of the Chunk Array</H4>
<P>
<A NAME="LMem_c.htm_IX_ChunkArrayHeader">
 </A>
A chunk array is contained in a single chunk in an LMem heap. It begins with a special header structure which specifies certain characteristics of the chunk array: the number of elements in the array, the size of each element (or zero for variable sized arrays), the offset from the start of the chunk to the first element, and the offset from the first element to the end of the array. The header is a structure of type <CODE>
ChunkArrayHeader</CODE>
; an application can examine the fields of this structure directly or by using chunk array routines. The creating application can request that the chunk array contain some blank space between the header and the first element; it can use that space however it likes.</P>
<P>
Elements can be referenced by index number. The first element has index number zero. You can translate element numbers to pointers, and vice versa, by calling <CODE>
ChunkArrayElementToPtr()</CODE>
 and <CODE>
ChunkArrayPtrToElement()</CODE>
 (see <A HREF="#LMem_c.htm_17554"> Adding, Removing, and Accessing Elements</A>
).</P>
<P>
A uniform-size chunk array has a simple structure. After the header (and the extra space, if any) come the elements. They follow one after another, with no free space between them. An application can request a pointer to any element, specified by index; the chunk array routine multiplies the index by the size of each element and adds the product to the address of the first element, producing a pointer to the requested element. An application can also proceed through the array, going from one element to the next, without specifically requesting pointers.
<IMG SRC="LMem_c_unifCArray.gif">

</P>
<P>
The structure of a variable-size chunk array is a little bit more complicated. After the header (and extra space) is a lookup-table of two-byte entries, each containing the offset from the start of the chunk to the appropriate element. The chunk array routines maintain this table automatically. When an application wants to reference a given element, the chunk array routine doubles the index number and adds it to the offset to the start of this table; this produces the address of a table entry, which itself contains the offset to the actual element. Effectively, there are two arrays with the same number of elements; the first is a uniform-sized array of offsets to the entries in the second (variable-sized) array. However, this is transparent to the application, which merely requests a pointer to element <EM>
n</EM>
 and is returned that pointer. It does not need to know or care about the extra table constructed by the chunk array routines.

Creating a Chunk Array</H4>
<PRE>ChunkArrayCreate(), ChunkArrayCreateAt(), ChunkArrayCreateAtHandles(), ChunkArrayHeader</PRE>
<P>
Chunk arrays are created in local memory heaps. An LMem heap can have several chunk arrays, and it can have other types of chunks besides chunk arrays; however, since an LMem heap is limited to 64K in total size, the more you put in the heap, the less room there is for a chunk array to grow.</P>
<P>
The first step in creating a chunk array is to create an LMem heap. Create the heap the same way you would any general LMem heap. The heap should probably be left resizable, since that way it will be able to grow to accommodate the chunk array.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="LMem_c.htm_IX_ChunkArrayCreate()">
 </A>
Once you have created the heap, use the routine <CODE>
ChunkArrayCreate()</CODE>
 to create the chunk array. This routine will allocate a chunk for the chunk array, initialize the array, and return the chunk handle. Since the routine allocates a chunk, it can cause chunk shuffling or heap resizing; thus, all pointers to the heap are invalidated. </P>
<P>
<CODE>
ChunkArrayCreate()</CODE>
 takes four arguments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The handle of a locked block containing the LMem heap;</LI>
<LI>
The size of each element, or zero if the elements are variable-size; and</LI>
<LI>
<A NAME="LMem_c.htm_IX_ChunkArrayHeader:with ChunkArrayCreate()">
 </A>
The size of the header for the chunk array. If you pass zero, the routine will automatically leave enough space for a <CODE>
ChunkArrayHeader</CODE>
 structure; if you pass a non-zero argument, it must be larger than the size of a <CODE>
ChunkArrayHeader</CODE>
. If you will need a data space at the start of the array, it is a good idea to define a structure, the first element of which is a <CODE>
ChunkArrayHeader</CODE>
, and use that structure to access the fixed data area; you can then pass the size of that structure as this argument.</LI>
<LI>
A field of <CODE>
ObjChunkFlags</CODE>
 which act as those passed to <CODE>
LMemAlloc()</CODE>

There is another version of this routine which creates a chunk array in an existing chunk.<A NAME="LMem_c.htm_IX_ChunkArrayCreateAt()">
 </A>
 This routine, <CODE>
ChunkArrayCreateAt()</CODE>
, takes three arguments, namely an optr indicating the chunk, the size of each element, and the size of the header. It allocates a chunk array in that chunk, resizing it if necessary, and returns the chunk's handle. Any data in the chunk may be overwritten (except for whatever data falls in the header area after the <CODE>

The chunk array library provides a high-level interface for working with the arrays. The application specifies a request in general terms (e.g., &quot;Insert a new element before element five,&quot; &quot;Give me a pointer to element 20&quot;). The routines take care of the low-level memory management: inserting bytes, swapping chunks to make room, etc. These routines depend on the LMem routines; therefore, the block containing the LMem heap must be locked or fixed when you use these routines (or any other chunk array routines).</P>
<P>
When you call a chunk array routine, you must pass the handles specifying the chunk. As with other routines which act on a chunk, these routines come in two formats: one in which the chunk is specified with an optr, and one in which it is specified with the global memory handle and the chunk handle.</P>

Element Arrays</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="LMem_d.htm_IX_Element arrays">
 </A>
Sometimes an application will create an array with a high duplication rate; that is, the array may contain many identical elements. This can be inefficient if the duplication rate is very high or elements are very large. For this reason, GEOS provides a special variant of the chunk array known as the <EM>
element array</EM>
. Every element in an element array has a reference count. When you insert an element, the insertion routine checks whether an identical element already exists in the array. If it does, the routine does not add another copy; instead, it increments the reference count of the element already in the array and returns its element index. If no such element exists, the routine copies the new element into the array, gives it a reference count of 1, and returns its element number. The application may specify a comparison routine which determines whether an element already exists in the array; or it may instruct the insertion routine to do a byte-level comparison.</P>
<P>
Note that elements in an element array may be of fixed, uniform size, or they may be of variable size (just as with chunk arrays). When you create an element array, you must specify the size of each element; specifying a size of zero indicates that the elements are of variable size.</P>
<P>
Members of an element array keep their index numbers until they are freed. If an element is deleted, the element array routines actually just resize the element to zero and add it to a free list. This means that an element with index 12 might not be the thirteenth element in the array, as it would in a chunk array (remember, indexes start with zero); there might be freed elements before it. For this reason, we speak of an element in an element array having a &quot;token&quot; instead of an index; you should generally consider a token to be an opaque value. Nevertheless, in most situations, element array tokens behave just like chunk array indexes.</P>
<P>
When you delete a reference to an element, its reference count is decremented. If the reference count reaches zero, the routine calls an application-specified callback routine to delete the element itself.</P>
<P>
Note that adding an element to an element array requires a linear search through the existing elements; thus, element arrays are inefficient for large numbers of elements, if elements will be continually added. Accessing elements, however, takes constant time, since the element array routines can quickly translate an element's token into the offset to that element. Thus, it takes no longer to access an element in an element array than it does to access one in a chunk array.</P>

Creating an Element Array</H4>
<PRE>ElementArrayCreate(), ElementArrayCreateAt(), ElementArrayCreateAtHandles(), ElementArrayHeader</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="LMem_d.htm_IX_ElementArrayCreate()">
 </A>
To create an element array, call the routine <CODE>
ElementArrayCreate()</CODE>
. Like <CODE>
ChunkArrayCreate()</CODE>
, it takes three arguments: the LMem heap's handle, the size of each element (or 0 for variable-sized elements), and the size to leave for the array header. The routine allocates a chunk in the LMem heap and initializes it as an element array. There is one significant difference: <A NAME="LMem_d.htm_IX_ElementArrayHeader">
 </A>
Element arrays begin with an <CODE>
ElementArrayHeader</CODE>
, a structure whose first component is a <CODE>
ChunkArrayHeader</CODE>
. If you are allocating free space between the header and the array, make sure to leave enough room for an <CODE>
ElementArrayHeader</CODE>
. If you do not need to allocate free space, you can pass a header size of zero, as with <CODE>
ChunkArrayCreate()</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
Note that when you specify the size of each element in the element array, you must include the size of each element's header. Thus, if each element's body were six bytes long, you would tell <CODE>
ElementArrayCreate()</CODE>
 that the size of each element is &quot;6 + sizeof(<CODE>
RefElementHeader</CODE>
)&quot;.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="LMem_d.htm_IX_ElementArrayCreateAt()">
 </A>
There is another version of this routine, <CODE>
ElementArrayCreateAt()</CODE>
, which creates the element array in a pre-existing chunk. This routine takes three arguments: an optr indicating the chunk, the size of each element, and the size of the header. It creates the element array in the specified chunk, resizing it if necessary. Any data in the chunk may be overwritten (except for whatever data falls in the header area after the <CODE>
ElementArrayHeader</CODE>
). <A NAME="LMem_d.htm_IX_ElementArrayCreateAtHandles()">
 </A>
There is also a version which takes handles instead of an optr; it is called <CODE>
ElementArrayCreateAtHandles()</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
The routine returns the handle of the newly-created element array. It can cause heap compaction or resizing; therefore, all pointers to the heap are invalidated.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Adding an Element</H4>
<PRE>ElementArrayAddElement(), ElementArrayAddElementHandles(), ElementArrayAddReference(), ElementArrayAddReferenceHandles()</PRE>
<P>
Adding an element to an element array is somewhat different from adding one to a chunk array. To add an element to a chunk array, you merely call the append routine, then write the element into the allocated space. If you want to add an element to an element array, you must first write out the data for the element in a buffer.<A NAME="LMem_d.htm_IX_ElementArrayAddElement()">
 </A>
 You then pass the address of this data to <CODE>
ElementArrayAddElement()</CODE>
, which compares your new element with the elements already in the array, and copies it into the array if necessary.</P>
<P>
<CODE>
ElementArrayAddElement()</CODE>
 takes four arguments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
An optr indicating the element array;</LI>
<LI>
The address of the element to copy into the array;</LI>
<LI>
A pointer to a callback comparison routine (see below), or a null pointer to do a byte-wise comparison;</LI>
<LI>
A dword of data to pass to the comparison routine.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
You may have your own criteria for deciding whether an element should be copied into an array. For example, elements in the array may have three data fields; perhaps you count two elements as matching if the first two data fields match. For this reason, <CODE>
ElementArrayAddElement()</CODE>
 lets you specify your own comparison routine. The callback routine should be a Boolean routine, declared _pascal, which takes three arguments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The address of the element to add;</LI>
<LI>
The address of an element in the array to compare the new element to; </LI>
<LI>
The callback data dword passed to <CODE>
ElementArrayAddElement()</CODE>
.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<CODE>
ElementArrayAddElement()</CODE>
 calls the callback routine to compare the new element to each element in the array. If the callback routine ever returns <EM>
true</EM>
, <CODE>
ElementArrayAddElement()</CODE>
 has found a matching element in the array; it will increment that element's reference count and return its index. If the callback routine returns <EM>
false</EM>
 for every element, <CODE>
ElementArrayAddElement()</CODE>
 copies the new element into the array and gives it a reference count of 1. It returns the element's index; the element will keep that index until it is freed. Note that there is no way to specify where in an element array a new element should be added. If there are free spaces in the array, the new element will be created in the first free space; otherwise, it will be appended to the end of the array.</P>
<P>
If you want to do a bytewise comparison, pass in a null pointer as the callback routine. <CODE>
ElementArrayAddElement()</CODE>
 will then do a bytewise comparison of the elements, treating two elements as equal only if every byte in the element <EM>
bodies</EM>
 matches. (It's okay if the two elements have different headers and reference counts; the bytewise comparison routine only compares the element bodies.) The bytewise comparison is implemented as a machine-language string instruction; it is therefore very fast. </P>
<P>
<A NAME="LMem_d.htm_IX_ElementArrayAddReference()">
 </A>
If you know that the element you want to add is already in the array, call <CODE>
ElementArrayAddReference()</CODE>

ElementArrayAddElement()</CODE>

Elements in element arrays are accessed in almost the same way as elements in chunk arrays. There is one major difference. Each element in an element array begins with a <CODE>

 checks to see if the element is identical to any other element in the array. It calls the comparison routine to compare elements. (You can force a bytewise comparison by passing a null function pointer; this comparison will make sure that all bytes in the element <EM>
body</EM>
 match, though it's okay if the elements have different values in their <CODE>
RefElementHeader</CODE>
 structures.) If it matches another element, the two elements will be combined; i.e., the element passed will be deleted, and the matching element will have its reference count increased appropriately. The matching element's token will be returned; you will have to change any references to the old element appropriately. If no match is found, the token which was passed will be returned. <A NAME="LMem_d.htm_IX_ElementArrayElementChangedHandles()">

When you want to remove an element from an element array, you should ordinarily call <CODE>

This routine takes four arguments: the optr of the array, the index of the element, a pointer to a callback routine, and a dword-sized constant to be passed to it. There may be certain bookkeeping tasks you want to perform when an element is actually being deleted but not when it is just having its reference count decremented. In this case, you can pass the address of a callback routine, which will be called on any element to be deleted just before the deletion occurs. After the callback routine returns, the element will be removed. If you do not need to have a callback routine called, pass a null function pointer. As noted, when an element is removed, it is actually just resized to zero; that way the index numbers of following elements are preserved.</P>

Sometimes its useful to have a special index system for element arrays. Perhaps you would like the used elements to be numbered sequentially, that is, the first &quot;used&quot; element would be element &quot;zero,&quot; even if there were free elements before it.

To find out the number of elements in an element array, call <CODE>

The routine takes three arguments: the optr to the element array, a dword of data which is passed to a callback routine, and a pointer to a Boolean callback routine. That callback routine should itself take two arguments: a pointer to an element, and the dword passed to <CODE>

<A NAME="LMem_e.htm_IX_Name arrays">
 </A>
Applications can build on chunk arrays and element arrays in many ways. The chunk array library includes one example of an elaboration on these structures: the <EM>
name array</EM>
. The name array is a special kind of element array in which elements can be accessed by a &quot;name&quot; label as well as by a token. Elements in a name array are of variable size. Each element is divided into three sections: The first is the <CODE>
RefElementHeader</CODE>
; every element in an element array must begin with one of these (and the name array is a kind of element array). The second is the data section. The data section is the same size for every element in a given name array; this size may be anything from zero bytes up to a maximum of<EM>
 </EM>
NAME_ARRAY_MAX_DATA_SIZE<EM>
 </EM>
(64 bytes). The data section is followed by a &quot;name&quot; section. This section contains a sequence of bytes of any length up to a maximum of NAME_ARRAY_MAX_NAME_SIZE (256 bytes). The name may contain nulls and need not be null terminated. You can translate a name into the element's token by calling <CODE>
NameArrayFind()</CODE>
 (described below).</P>
<P>
Note that creating elements in a name array, as in any element array, requires a search through all elements; it thus takes linear time. Furthermore, translating a name into a token also requires a linear search through the elements, and thus also takes linear time. Name arrays thus become slow if they grow too large. Accessing an element by token, however, still takes constant time.</P>

. However, instead of being passed a memory handle, <CODE>
NameArrayCreateAt()</CODE>
 is passed an optr to a chunk. The name array will be created in that chunk. Any data in that chunk (outside of the fixed data area) will be destroyed. Note that if the chunk is too small for the name array, <CODE>
NameArrayCreateAt()</CODE>
 will resize it; thus, pointers to the LMem heap may be invalidated. <A NAME="LMem_e.htm_IX_NameArrayCreateAtHandles()">
 </A>
There is a version of this routine which takes the chunk's global and chunk handles instead of its optr; this routine is called <CODE>
NameArrayCreateAtHandles()</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="LMem_e.htm_IX_NameArrayAdd()">
 </A>
To create an element, call <CODE>
NameArrayAdd()</CODE>
. This routine creates an element and copies the data and name into it. The routine takes five arguments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The optr to the name array.</LI>
<LI>
A pointer to an array of characters containing the element's name.</LI>
<LI>
The length of the name, in bytes. This many characters will be copied into the name. If you pass a length of zero, bytes will be copied until a null byte is reached (the null will not be copied).</LI>
<LI>
A word-length set of <CODE>
NameArrayAddFlags</CODE>
. Only one flag is currently defined, namely NAAF_SET_DATA_ON_REPLACE. This flag is described below.</LI>
<LI>
A pointer to the data section. The data will be copied into the new element. (The length of the data portion was specified when the name array was created.)</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<CODE>
NameArrayAdd()</CODE>
 allocates the element, copies in the data and name, and returns the element's token. If an element with the specified name already exists, <CODE>
NameArrayAdd()</CODE>
 will not create a duplicate. Instead, if the flag NAAF_SET_DATA_ON_REPLACE was passed, <CODE>
NameArrayAdd()</CODE>
 will copy the new data section into the existing element; if the flag was not passed, it will leave the existing element unchanged. In either case, it will return the existing element's token and increment its reference count. If an element is added, the name array may have to be resized; therefore, pointers into the chunk array will be invalidated. <A NAME="LMem_e.htm_IX_NameArrayAddHandles()">
 </A>
There is a version in which the name array is specified by its global and chunk handles; this version is called <CODE>
NameArrayAddHandles()</CODE>

<A NAME="LMem_e.htm_IX_NameArrayFind()">

If you know the name of an element and want a copy of its data, call <CODE>
NameArrayFind()</CODE>
. This routine is passed four arguments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The optr to the name array.</LI>
<LI>
A pointer to a character buffer. The buffer should contain the name of the element sought.</LI>
<LI>
The length of the name. If a length of zero is passed, the name is considered to be null terminated (the trailing null is <EM>
not</EM>
 part of the name).</LI>
<LI>
A pointer to a return buffer. The data portion of the element will be copied to this location.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<CODE>
NameArrayFind()</CODE>
 will do a linear search through the elements. If it finds one with the name specified, it will return that element's token and copy the data portion into the return buffer. If there is no element with the specified name, <CODE>
NameArrayFind()</CODE>
 will return the constant CA_NULL_ELEMENT. <A NAME="LMem_e.htm_IX_NameArrayFindHandles()">

To change an element's name, call <CODE>
NameArrayChangeName()</CODE>
. This routine is passed four arguments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The optr to the name array.</LI>
<LI>
The token of the element whose name will be changed.</LI>
<LI>
A pointer to a character buffer containing the new name for the element.</LI>
<LI>
The length of the new name. If a length of zero is passed, the name is considered to be null terminated (the trailing null is <EM>
not</EM>
 part of the name).</LI>
</UL>

<CODE>
NameArrayChangeName()</CODE>
 changes the element's name. If the new name is longer than the old, the element will have to be resized; this will invalidate pointers within that block.<A NAME="LMem_e.htm_IX_NameArrayChangeNameHandles()">
