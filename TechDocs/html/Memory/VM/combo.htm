Most disk-operating systems provide minimal file functionality. A file is simply treated as a sequence of bytes; applications can copy data from files to memory or vice versa, but nothing more elaborate. GEOS provides much more elaborate functionality with its <CODE>
Virtual Memory</CODE>
 files.</P>
<P>
Virtual Memory (VM) is very useful for two reasons. First, it is often impractical to read an entire disk file into contiguous memory; indeed, it is impossible to do so if the file is larger than 64K. The use of virtual memory allows each file to grow arbitrarily large. Second, each disk file is one long, cumbersome stream of data. By using virtual memory files, applications can break files down into smaller, more manageable blocks which the memory manager can handle more efficiently.</P>

Design Philosophy</H2>
<P>
The GEOS Virtual Memory file management system is designed to provide features not easily available with standard file systems. Designed primarily for use by applications for long-term data storage, it is also used by the system for many other purposes, such as to provide state saving (in the UI). The main benefits it provides to applications include the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Convenient file structure<BR>
GEOS divides VM files into VM blocks, each of which is accessed via a VM block handle. This structure is much like a &quot;disk-based heap,&quot; and is analogous to (and compatible with) the memory heap. VM blocks are accessed the same way whether they are on disk or resident in memory. They can be independently resized and locked.</LI>
<LI>
Ease of file manipulation<BR>
Many file manipulation techniques are much simpler with VM files. For example, geodes do not have to keep track of which blocks they have changed; instead, when they change a block, they mark it as dirty, and when they update the file, the virtual memory routines will automatically copy just the changed blocks to the disk.</LI>
<LI>
Sharing of Data Files<BR>
GEOS maintains information about each VM file and knows when more than one thread is using it. This allows the system to notify all users when one thread has modified a file. The system provides data synchronization for individual blocks.</LI>
<LI>
Integrity of Data Files<BR>
GEOS provides several features to protect the integrity of VM files. For example, you can request that GEOS maintain a backup that can be used to restore the file to its last-saved state. In addition, you can have GEOS do all writing to the file synchronously to ensure that all the data in the file stays consistent even if GEOS is somehow interrupted.</LI>
<LI>
Uniform File Structure<BR>
Because all GEOS data files are based on VM files, utilities can be written which work for all VM files. For example, the Document Control objects can take care of opening, closing, and saving all data files which are based on VM files. Furthermore, data structures can be designed which can be added at will into any VM file.</LI>

VM Structure</H2>
<P>
Virtual memory can be thought of as a heap stored in a disk file. Like the global heap, it is divided into blocks which are 64K or smaller; each block is accessed via a handle. Blocks can be locked, which brings them into main memory. If blocks are modified while in memory, they are copied back to the file when the file is updated.</P>
<P>
The primary component of virtual memory is the VM file. The VM file consists of a VM File Header, a collection of VM blocks, and a special structure called a VM Header. The VM File Header is a standard GEOS file header, containing the file's extended attributes and system bookkeeping information. Geodes may not access it directly; instead, they can make calls to the <EM>
extended attributes</EM>
 routines to access data in the header. The VM blocks and the VM Header do not occupy fixed places in the file. In particular, the VM Header does not necessarily come before all the blocks. Instead, the VM File Header stores the offset within the file to the VM Header, and the VM Header stores information about the blocks (such as their locations in the file). Furthermore, the blocks in a VM file are arranged in no particular order; they are not necessarily arranged in the order they were created, or in any other sequence. 
<IMG SRC="VM_2_file.gif">

</P>
<P>
The VM Header maintains all the bookkeeping information about the VM file. For example, it contains the VM Block Table. The block table is much like the global handle table. Block handles are offsets into the block handle table; a block's entry in the table contains information about the block, such as the block's location in the file. Usually, the Block Table contains entries for blocks that haven't been created yet; when all of these handles have been used, the VM Manager expands the block table.

The VM Manager</H3>
<P>
The VM manager can be thought of as a memory manager for a disk-based heap, providing all the services a memory manager would and more. The VM manager provides for allocation, use, and deallocation of virtual memory blocks. It manages the Block Table, enlarging it as necessary when more VM block handles are needed. It keeps track of which VM blocks have been loaded into memory, which are currently in use, and which have been &quot;dirtied&quot; (modified) since they were read from the disk; it also keeps track of how many threads are accessing a given VM file at any time. The VM manager also accomplishes all swapping and read/write operations involving VM files. </P>

<A HREF="#index.htm">Virtual Memory</A>: 2.2 <A HREF="#VM_2.htm">VM Structure</A>: 
VM Handles</H3>
<P>
There are several different types of handles associated with VM files. It is important not to get them confused.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
File Handles<BR>
When you open or create a VM file, it is assigned a file handle, as discussed in <A HREF="../../Files/FileSys/combo.htm">the File System chapter</A>. Whenever you call a VM routine, you must specify the VM file by passing this handle. The file handle can change each time the file is opened. Furthermore, if two different network users have the same VM file open at the same time, each user might have a different file handle for the same file.</LI><LI>
VM Block Handles<BR>
<A NAME="VM_4.htm_IX_Handles:VM block handles">
 </A>
The VM file has a block table in the VM Header. The block table contains the locations of blocks in the file. A given block has the same block handle every time the file is opened. If a file is duplicated, blocks in the new file will have the same VM handles as the corresponding blocks in the old file. In this chapter, references to &quot;block handles&quot; or &quot;VM handles&quot; are referring to VM block handles unless otherwise noted.</LI>
<LI>
Memory Block Handles<BR>
When a VM block is locked, it is copied into a memory block. This memory block has an entry in the global handle table. The memory block may persist even after the VM block has been unlocked. Ordinarily, you can refer to a VM block by its VM block handle whether or not it is resident in memory; however, in some cases, you may want to use the memory block handle instead of the VM block handle. This saves time when you know the block is resident in memory, because the VM manager doesn't have to translate the VM block handle into the corresponding global handle. It is also necessary if you need to resize or dirty a VM block. You can instruct the VM manager to use the same global handle each time a given VM block is locked until the file is closed; otherwise, the memory handle for a VM block may change each time the block is locked.</LI>
<LI>
Chunk Handles and Database/Cell Handles<BR>
A VM block can contain a local memory heap. If so, that block will have its own chunk handle table. Also, the Database and Cell libraries have been designed to let the VM file efficiently manipulate small pieces of data. These libraries are based on the LMem library. Each item of data has its own DB handle as well as a VM Block handle. Database items are discussed in depth in <A HREF="../../Memory/Database/combo.htm">the Database chapter</A>.</LI></UL>

Virtual Memory Blocks</H3>
<P>
Most file systems treat files as a string of bytes. A user can read a file sequentially or can start reading at a specified distance into the file. This makes it difficult to work with large files. Reading an entire large file into memory may be impractical, and it may be difficult to access different parts of the file at once.</P>
<P>
For this reason, GEOS divides its Virtual Memory files into VM blocks. This division is entirely internal to GEOS. When the file is written to disk, it is still a sequence of bytes, and other operating systems can copy the file normally. However, GEOS geodes can access the file much more conveniently by specifying the blocks they wish to access.</P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
The Nature of VM Blocks</H4>
<P>
A VM block is a sequence of bytes in a VM file. It must be small enough to fit in a global memory block (i.e. 64K or less, preferably 2K-6K). It may move about in the file; for this reason, it is accessed by a VM block handle. Blocks are either <EM>
free</EM>
 or <EM>
used</EM>
. A used block has an entry in the block table and also a space allocated in the file. (This could be a block of free space, which will be freed the next time the file is compacted.) A free block has a slot in the file's handle table but no space in the file; it is available if a thread needs to allocate a block. </P>
<P>
Blocks persist after a file has been closed and GEOS has been shut down. A given block is always accessed by the same block handle. There are utilities to copy blocks within a VM file or between files. Blocks in a VM file are in no particular order. If an application wants to set up a sequence of blocks, it can create a VM Chain, in which the first word of each block is the handle of the next block in the chain. However, even chained blocks will probably not be in order in the actual file.</P>
<P>
Each VM block can be assigned a &quot;user ID&quot; number. You can request the handles of the VM blocks with any given ID number. You do not have to assign ID numbers to blocks, but it is sometimes convenient. The ID numbers are stored in the handles' entries in the block table, not in the blocks themselves; this makes it easy to find a block with a specified user ID. User IDs can be changed at will with the routine <CODE>
VMModifyUserID()</CODE>
. Note that all user IDs from 0xff00 to 0xffff are reserved for system use. You can find a block with a specific user ID by calling <CODE>
VMFind()</CODE>
; see <A HREF="#VM_d.htm_49253"> You can locate VM blocks by their user ID numbers. The routine VMFind() takes three arguments: the VM file handle, a VM block handle, and the user ID for which to look. The routine looks through the block table, starting with the handle after th</A>
.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Creating and Using VM Blocks</H4>
<P>
There are two ways you can create a VM block. The first is to request a VM block: You specify the size of the block, the block is created, and you are returned the handle. This is the method ordinarily used. The second method is to attach memory to a block: You create a global memory block, and instruct the VM manager to add it to the VM file. There are sometimes advantages to this technique; for example, you can create an LMem heap, and then attach it to the VM file; it will then be saved with the file. You can also attach a memory block to an existing VM block; this will destroy whatever used to be in the VM block and replace it with the contents of the new block.

</P>
<P>
You can dynamically resize a VM block by locking it into memory, resizing the memory block, and saving it back to the disk.</P>
<P>
These techniques are described in detail in <A HREF="#VM_b.htm_97342"> Creating and Freeing Blocks</A>
 and <A HREF="#VM_c.htm_75170"> Attaching Memory Blocks</A>
.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
<A NAME="VM_5.htm_58484">
 </A>
File Compaction
<IMG SRC="VM_5_compaction.gif">

</H4>
<P>
When a VM block is freed, the VM manager will note that there is empty space in the file. It will use that space when new blocks are allocated. However, since new blocks will probably not fit exactly in the spaces left by freed blocks, some space may be wasted. </P>
<P>
In time, the percentage of wasted file space can grow unacceptably large. To prevent this, the Virtual Memory manager periodically compacts the files. When the ratio of data to free space drops below a certain threshold, the Virtual Memory manager copies the data in the file over the free space. While a file is being compacted, any requests for access to the file will block until compaction is finished. Note that the format of the data is not changed; the free space between data blocks is simply removed.</P>
<P>
When a geode creates a VM file, it can specify a &quot;compaction threshold.&quot; When the percentage of used space drops below this threshold, the VM manager will automatically compact the file without any attention from the application. The geode should take care in setting the threshold. If the threshold is too low, the file may grow unacceptably large before it is compacted; on the other hand, if the threshold is too high, the VM manager might spend too much time compacting the file for relatively low gains. The application can specify a threshold of zero; this will cause the system default threshold to be used.</P>
<P>
Note that if a file is in &quot;backup mode,&quot; the file will be compacted only on calls to <CODE>
VMSave()</CODE>
, <CODE>
VMSaveAs()</CODE>
, or <CODE>
VMRevert()</CODE>
. If the file is not in backup mode, it can be compacted on any call to <CODE>
VMUpdate()</CODE>
. </P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
File Updating and Backup</H4>
<P>
When a block is locked into memory, the VM manager copies the data from the disk block to the global memory block. When the block is unlocked, the VM manager assumes that it can discard the memory block, since the data is already on the disk in the VM block.</P>
<P>
If you alter the data in a block, you must notify the VM manager of this fact. You do this by marking the block as <EM>
dirty</EM>
. When a block has been marked dirty, the VM manager knows that the version in memory is more up-to-date than the version in the disk file. If the flag VMA_SYNC_UPDATE is <EM>
off</EM>
 (the default), the block will be written back to the file as soon as possible. If the attribute is <EM>
on</EM>
, the block will not be copied back to the disk file until <CODE>
VMUpdate()</CODE>
 is called; until then, the block will be copied to the disk swap space if memory is needed. The next time you lock the block, you will be given the new, changed version.</P>
<P>
When you want to write the dirty blocks to the disk, you can instruct the VM manager to <EM>
update</EM>
 the file. This copies all the dirtied blocks back to the disk and marks all blocks as <EM>
clean</EM>
. The VM manager also automatically updates the file when it is closed. The updating routines check if the file is currently clean; thus, very little time is lost if you try to update a clean file.</P>
<P>
The VM manager can be instructed to notify all users of a file when the file changes from clean to dirty. This has two main uses: it helps maintain data synchronization if many geodes are using the same file, and it lets the document control objects know when to enable the &quot;Save&quot; and &quot;Revert&quot; triggers. (See <A HREF="../../Files/Documents/combo.htm">the Documents Objects chapter</A>.)</P><P>
The VM manager can be instructed to maintain a backup of a file. If it is so instructed, it will not overwrite the original block when it updates it; instead, it will keep a copy of the original block as well as a copy of the new version. This is transparent to the application. When the VM Manager is instructed to <EM>
save</EM>
 the file, it deletes all the backup blocks. If it is instructed to <EM>
revert</EM>
 the file to its last-saved version, it replaces the new version of the changed blocks with the backup versions, thus restoring the file to its condition as of the last time it was saved. If the VM manager is instructed to <EM>
&quot;save-as&quot;</EM>
 the file, it will create a new file, which does not contain the backup blocks; that is, it contains the file as it currently exists. It will then revert the original file to its last-saved version and close it.</P>

There are five basic steps to using VM files. The steps are outlined below, and described in greater detail in the following sections.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Open (or create) the VM file<BR>
Before you perform any actions on a VM file, you must open it with <CODE>
VMOpen()</CODE>
. This routine can be used to open an existing VM file or create a new one. If you use the document control objects, they will open and create files automatically. Once you have created a VM file, you may want to change its attributes with <CODE>
VMSetAttributes()</CODE>
.</LI>
<LI>
Bring a VM block into the global memory heap<BR>
After you open a VM file, you can bring blocks from the file into memory with <CODE>
VMLock()</CODE>
. You can also create new blocks with <CODE>
VMAlloc()</CODE>
 and <CODE>
VMAttach()</CODE>
.</LI>
<LI>
Access the data<BR>
Once a VM block has been brought into memory, you can access it the way you would any other memory block. When you are done with the data, you should unlock it with <CODE>
VMUnlock()</CODE>
. If you change the memory, you should mark it dirty with <CODE>
VMDirty()</CODE>
 before unlocking it. This ensures that the new version of the block will be written to the disk.</LI>
<LI>
Update the VM file<BR>
Use one of the several VM updating routines to copy the dirty blocks back to the disk. (If asynchronous update is allowed, the VM file manager will try to update blocks whenever they are unlocked.)</LI>
<LI>
Close the VM file<BR>
Use <CODE>
VMClose()</CODE>
 when you are done with the file. It will update the file and close it.</LI>

<LI>
File name<BR>
This argument is a pointer to a string of characters. This string is a relative or absolute path specifying the file to open; if a temporary file is being created, the string is the path of the directory in which to place that file, followed by fourteen null bytes (counting the string-ending null). The name of the temporary file is appended to the path.</LI>
<LI>
<CODE>
VMAccessFlags<BR>
</CODE>
This argument is a set of flags which specifies how the file is accessed. The flags are described below.</LI>
<LI>
<CODE>
VMOpenType</CODE>
 enumerated type<BR>
This argument specifies how the file should be opened. The <CODE>
VMOpenType</CODE>
 are described below.</LI>
<LI>
Compaction threshold<BR>
This is the minimum percentage of a file which must be used for data at any given time. If the percentage drops below this threshold, the file is compacted. If you pass a threshold of zero, the system default threshold is used. The compaction threshold is set only when the file is created; this argument is ignored if an existing file is opened.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
When you use <CODE>
VMOpen()</CODE>
, you must specify how the file should be opened. <A NAME="VM_9.htm_IX_VMO_&ldots;">
 </A>
<A NAME="VM_9.htm_IX_VMOpenType">
 </A>
You do this by passing a member of the <CODE>

 enumerated type. The types are as follows:</P>
<DL>
<DT>
VMO_TEMP_FILE</DT><DD>
If this is passed, the file will be a temporary data file. When you create a temporary file, you pass a directory path, not a file name. The path should be followed by fourteen null bytes, including the string's terminating null. The system will choose an appropriate file name and add it to the path string.</DD>
<DT>
VMO_CREATE_ONLY</DT><DD>
If this is passed, the document will be created. If a document with the specified name already exists in the working directory, <CODE>
VMOpen()</CODE>

<DT>
VMO_CREATE</DT><DD>
If this is passed, the file will be created if it does not already exist; otherwise it will be opened.</DD>
<DT>
VMO_CREATE_TRUNCATE</DT><DD>
If this is passed, the file will be created if it does not already exist; otherwise, it will be opened and truncated (all data blocks will be freed).</DD>

</DL>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_9.htm_IX_VMAF_&ldots;">

You also have to specify what type of access to the file you would like. You do this by passing a record of <CODE>
VMAccessFlags</CODE>
. This is a byte-length bitfield. The following flags are available:</P>
<DL>
<DT>
VMAF_FORCE_READ_ONLY</DT><DD>
If set, the file will be opened read-only, even if the default would be to open the file read/write. Blocks in read-only files cannot be dirtied, and changes in memory blocks will not be updated to the disk VM blocks.</DD>
<DT>
VMAF_FORCE_READ_WRITE</DT><DD>
If set, the file will be opened for read/write access, even if the default would be to open the file for read-only access.</DD>
<DT>
VMAF_SHARED_MEMORY</DT><DD>
If set, the VM manager should try to use shared memory when locking VM blocks; that is, the same memory block will be used for a given VM block no matter which thread locks the block.</DD>
<DT>
VMAF_FORCE_DENY_WRITE</DT><DD>
If set, the file will be opened deny-write; that is, no other threads will be allowed to open the file for read/write access.</DD>
<DT>
VMAF_DISALLOW_SHARED_MULTIPLE</DT><DD>
If this flag is set, files with the file attribute GFHF_SHARED_MULTIPLE cannot be opened.</DD>
<DT>
VMAF_USE_BLOCK_LEVEL_SYNCHRONIZATION</DT><DD>
If set, the block-level synchronization mechanism of the VM manager is assumed to be sufficient; the more restrictive file-level synchronization is not used. This is primarily intended for system software. (See <A HREF="#VM_12.htm_57104"> File-Access Synchronization</A>
.)<A NAME="VM_9.htm_marker=377562">
 </A>
</DD>
</DL>
<P>
If you open a file with VMAF_FORCE_READ_ONLY, it's generally a good idea to also open it with VMAF_FORCE_DENY_WRITE. When you open a file VMAF_FORCE_READ_ONLY, if the file is writable, and is located on a writable device which can be used by other machines (e.g. a network drive), the kernel will load the entire file into memory and make the blocks non-discardable (even when they are clean); this keeps the file you see consistent, even if another user changes the version of the file on the disk. However, this can cause problems if the machine has limited swap space. If the file is opened with VMAF_FORCE_DENY_WRITE, no other device will be allowed to change the file while you have it open, which means the kernel can just load and discard blocks as necessary.

</P>

The routine <CODE>
VMOpen()</CODE>
 returns the file handle. If it cannot satisfy the request, it returns a null handle and sets the thread error word. The error word can be recovered with the <CODE>

 will automatically allocate a memory block, copy the VM block's data into it, and return the memory block's handle. If the VM block was dirty, the block will be updated to the file before it is detached. The next time the VM block is locked, a new global memory block will be allocated for it.</P>

Accessing and Altering VM Blocks</H3>
<PRE>VMLock(), VMUnlock(), VMDirty(), VMFind(), VMModifyUserID(), VMPreserveBlocksHandle()</PRE>
<P>
Once you have opened a VM file and allocated blocks, you will need to access blocks. The VM library provides many routines for doing this.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_d.htm_IX_VMLock()">
 </A>
If you need to access the data in a VM file, you can use the routine <CODE>
VMLock()</CODE>
. This routine moves a VM block onto the global heap. It does this by allocating a global memory block (if the VM block is not already associated with a memory block), reallocating the global block if it had been discarded, locking the memory block on the global heap, and copying the VM block into the global block, if necessary. (It will copy the VM block to memory only if necessary, i.e. if the memory block is newly-allocated, or had been discarded and reallocated.) <CODE>
VMLock()</CODE>
 takes three arguments: the handle of the VM file, the VMBlockHandle of the block to lock, and a pointer to a memHandle variable.<A NAME="VM_d.htm_IX_VMUnlock()">
 </A>
 It returns a pointer to the start of the block, and writes the global block's handle into the memHandle variable. You can now access the block the same way you would any other block, with one exception: When you are done with the block, you do not call <CODE>
MemUnlock()</CODE>
; instead, call the routine <CODE>
VMUnlock()</CODE>
, passing it the handle of the <EM>
global memory</EM>
 block (not the handle of the VM block). This will unlock the global block on the heap.</P>
<P>
If you alter the global memory block, you will need to notify the VM manager of this so it will know to copy the changes back to the VM file.<A NAME="VM_d.htm_IX_VMDirty()">
 </A>
 You do this by calling the routine <CODE>
VMDirty()</CODE>
. <CODE>
VMDirty()</CODE>
 takes one argument, the handle of the global memory block (<EM>
not</EM>
 the VM block). It is important to dirty the block while it is still locked on the heap; as soon as you unlock a clean block, the VM manager may choose to discard it. Dirty blocks are copied back to the VM file when it is updated. Note that if an object in a VM block is marked dirty (via <CODE>
ObjMarkDirty()</CODE>
), the block is automatically dirtied. Similarly, if you attach a global memory block to a VM block (via <CODE>
VMAttach()</CODE>
), the VM block is automatically dirtied.

</P>
<P>
You can dynamically resize VM blocks. <A NAME="VM_d.htm_IX_VMLock()">
 </A>
To do this, lock the VM block with <CODE>
VMLock()</CODE>
; then resize the global memory block with <CODE>
MemReAlloc()</CODE>
. Be sure to mark the block dirty so the changes will be copied to the disk file. Note that although the global memory block will remain locked, it may move on the global heap when it is resized. You will therefore need to dereference the global memory handle (with <CODE>
MemDeref()</CODE>

after</EM>
 the one passed, until it finds a block with the specified user ID. If it does not find such a block, it returns a null handle; otherwise, it returns the block's VMBlockHandle. Thus, by passing in a block handle of zero, you will get the handle of the first block with the specified ID; by passing back in that block's handle, you will get the next block with that ID; and so on, until you get all the blocks (after which you will be returned a null handle). </P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_d.htm_IX_VMModifyUserID()">
 </A>
You can change a block's user ID number by calling the routine <CODE>
VMModifyUserID()</CODE>
. This routine takes three arguments: the VM file handle, the VM block handle, and the new user ID number. Since user IDs are maintained in the block table, not in the blocks themselves, it doesn't matter whether the block is locked, or even whether it is associated with data in the file.

Ordinarily, the VM manager can free any unlocked, clean global block if the space is needed. However, you can instruct the VM manager not to free the global block associated with a specific block by calling the routine <CODE>

 could not finish updating a file (for example, because the disk ran out of space), <CODE>
VMClose()</CODE>
 will return an error message, but will close the file and free the memory anyway. Thus, the most recent changes will be lost. For this reason, it is usually safer to first update the file (and handle any error messages returned) and then close it.</P>

When GEOS shuts down, all files are closed. When it restarts, you can open the files manually. </P>

Sometimes several different geodes will need access to the same VM file. Generally, these will be several different copies of the same application, perhaps running on different machines on a network. GEOS provides three different ways shared-access can be handled.</P>
<P>
A VM file can be one of three different types: standard, &quot;public,&quot; and &quot;shared-multiple.&quot; By default, all new VM files are standard. The file's type is one of its extended attributes, and can be changed with the routine <CODE>
FileSetHandleExtendedAttributes()</CODE>
 (see <A HREF="../../Files/FileSys/FileSys_d.htm#49785">the File System chapter</A>). The document control automatically lets the user select what kind of file to create, and changes its type accordingly. (See <A HREF="../../Files/Documents/combo.htm">the Document Objects chapter</A>.)</P><P>
Only one geode may write to a standard GEOS VM file at a time. If a geode has the file open for read/write access, no other geode will be allowed to open that file. If a geode has the file open for read-only access, other geodes are allowed to open it for read-only access, but not for read-write access. If a file is opened for read-only access, blocks cannot be dirtied or updated. If a geode tries to open a file for writing when the file is already open, or if the geode tries to open it for reading when the file has already been opened for writing, <CODE>
VMOpen()</CODE>
 will return an error.</P>
<P>
In general, when a file is opened, it is by default opened for read-write access. For example, the document control objects present a dialog box which lets the file be opened for read-only access, but has this option initially turned off. However, some files are used mainly for reference and are infrequently changed. For example, a company might keep a client address book on a network drive. Most of the time, people would just read this file; the file would only occasionally be changed. For this reason, GEOS lets you declare VM file as &quot;public.&quot; Public files are, by default, opened for read-only access. In all other respects the file is the same as a standard GEOS VM file; it can be opened by several readers at a time, but by only one geode at a time if the geode will be writing.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_12.htm_IX_VMGrabExclusive()">
 </A>
Sometimes several geodes will need to be able to write to a file at once. For example, a company might have a large customer database, and several users might be writing records to the database at the same time. For this reason, GEOS lets you create &quot;shared-multiple&quot; files. Several geodes can have a &quot;shared-multiple&quot; file open at once. However, a geode cannot access the file whenever it wants. Instead, it must get the file's semaphore to access the file's data. When it needs to access the file, it calls <CODE>

A VM file is just a collection of blocks. These blocks are not kept in any particular order. If the application wants to keep the blocks in some kind of order, it must set up some mechanism to do this.</P>

One common mechanism is the VM chain. This is simply a way of arranging blocks in a sequence, in which each block contains the handle of the next block. GEOS has a standard format for VM chains and provides utility routines which work with chains of this format.</P>
<P>
In general usage, a &quot;chain&quot; is a simple tree in which each block has a link to at most one other block. However, the GEOS VM chain can also contain special &quot;tree blocks,&quot; which may have links to any number of child blocks.

Structure of a VM Chain</H3>
<P>
A VM chain is composed of two kinds of blocks: chain blocks (which are linked to at most one other block), and tree blocks (which may be linked to any number of other blocks). One block is the head of the chain; chain utility routines can be passed the handle of this block, and they will act on all the blocks in the chain. If a block is a &quot;leaf&quot; block, it should contain a null handle. An example of a VM chain with tree blocks is shown in the figure below.
<IMG SRC="VM_15_vmChain.gif">

</P>
<P>
Be warned that a VM chain must not contain any circuits. That is, by following links, you should not be able to go from any block back to itself; and there should not be two different routes from any one block to any other. If you create such a VM chain and pass it to a chain utility, the results are undefined. It is your responsibility to make sure no loops occur.

</P>
<P>
A VM chain block is the same as any other VM block, with one exception: The block must begin with a <CODE>
VMChainLink</CODE>
 structure. This structure contains a single data field, <CODE>
VMC_next</CODE>
, which is the handle of the next block in the chain. If the block is in a chain but has no next link, <CODE>
VMC_next</CODE>
 is a null handle. This means, for example, that LMem heaps cannot belong to a VM chain (since LMem heaps must begin with an <CODE>
LMemHeader</CODE>
 structure). </P>
<P>
In addition to chain blocks, a VM chain may contain a tree block. A tree block may have several links to blocks. <A NAME="VM_15.htm_IX_VMCT_&ldots;">
 </A>
<A NAME="VM_15.htm_IX_VMChainTree">

VMCT_meta</DT><DD>

This is a <CODE>

 field must be set to the special value VM_CHAIN_TREE.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
VMCT_offset</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This is the offset within the block to the first link. All data in the tree block must be placed between the <CODE>

Huge Arrays</H2>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_17.htm_IX_HugeArray">
 </A>
Sometimes a geode needs to work with an array that can get very large. Chunk arrays are very convenient, but they are limited to the size of an LMem heap, which is slightly less than 64K; furthermore, their performance begins to degrade when they get larger than 6K. Similarly, if a geode uses raw memory for an array, it is limited to the maximum size of a global memory block, again 64K.</P>
<P>
For this reason, GEOS provides the Huge Array library. A Huge Array is stored in a VM file. All the elements are stored in VM blocks, as is the directory information. The application can specify an array element by its index, and the Huge Array routine will lock the block containing that element and return its address. Array indices are dword-sized, meaning a Huge Array can have up to
2<small><sup>32</sup></small>
elements. Since elements are stored in VM blocks, each element has a maximum size of 64K; however, the size of the entire array is limited only by the amount of disk space available. The blocks in a Huge Array are linked together in a VM chain, so the VM chain utilities can be used to duplicate, free, and compare Huge Arrays.</P>
<P>
There are a couple of disadvantages to using Huge Arrays. The main disadvantage is that it takes longer to access an element: the routine has to lock the directory block, look up the index to find out which block contains the element, lock that block, calculate the offset into that block for the element, and return its address. (However, elements are consecutive within blocks; thus, you can often make many array accesses with a single Huge Array lookup command.) There is also a certain amount of memory overhead for Huge Arrays. Thus, if you are confident that the array size will be small enough for a single block, you are generally better off with a Chunk Array (see <A HREF="../../Memory/LMem/LMem_c.htm#72816">the Local Memory chapter</A>).</P><P>
Huge arrays may have fixed-size or variable-sized elements. If elements are variable-sized, there is a slight increase in memory overhead, but no significant slowdown in data-access time.</P>

<A HREF="#index.htm">Virtual Memory</A>: 5.1 <A HREF="#VM_17.htm">Huge Arrays</A>: 
Structure of a Huge Array</H3>
<P>
The huge array has two different type of blocks: a single directory block, and zero or more data blocks. The blocks are linked together in a simple (i.e., non-branching) VM chain. The directory block is the head of the chain. A Huge Array is identified by the handles of the VM file containing the array and the directory block at the head of the array.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_18.htm_IX_HugeArrayDirectory">
 </A>
The directory block is a special kind of LMem block. It contains a header structure of type <CODE>
HugeArrayDirectory</CODE>
 (which begins with an <CODE>
LMemBlockHeader</CODE>
 structure), followed by an optional fixed data area, which is followed by a chunk array. <A NAME="VM_18.htm_IX_HugeArrayDirEntry">
 </A>
The chunk array is an array of <CODE>
HugeArrayDirEntry</CODE>
 structures. There is one such structure for each data block; the structure contains the handle of the data block, the size of the block, and the index number of the last element in the block.</P>
<P>
Each data block is also a special LMem block. It contains a <CODE>
HugeArrayBlock</CODE>
 structure (which begins with an <CODE>
LMemBlockHeader</CODE>
 structure) and is followed by a chunk array of elements. If the Huge Array has variable-sized elements, so will each data block's chunk array.

</P>
<P>
When you want to look up a specific element, the Huge Array routines lock the directory block. They then read through the directory chunk array until they find the block which contains the specified element. At this point, the routine knows both which data block contains the element and which element it is in that block's chunk array. (For example, if you look up element 1,000, the Huge Array routine might find out that block <EM>
x</EM>
 ends with element 950 and block <EM>
y</EM>
 ends with element 1,020. The routine thus knows that element 1,000 in the Huge Array is in the chunk array in block <EM>
y</EM>
, and its element number is 50 in that block's array.)</P>
<P>
The routine then unlocks the directory block, and locks the data block containing that element. It returns a pointer to that element. It also returns the number of elements occurring before and after that element in that chunk array. The calling geode can access all the elements in that block without further calls to Huge Array routines.</P>
<P>
When you insert or delete an element, the Huge Array routines look up the element index as described above. They then call the appropriate chunk array routine to insert or delete the element in that data block. They then go through the directory and adjust the element numbers throughout. If inserting an element in a data block would bring the block's size above some system-defined threshold, the Huge Array routine automatically divides the data block.</P>
<P>
When the VM routines resize an element block, they automatically make the block larger than necessary. This leaves extra space for future insertions in that block, so the block won't have to be resized the next time an element is added. This improves efficiency, since you may often be adding several elements to the same block. However, this also means that most Huge Arrays have a fair amount of unused space. If you won't be adding elements to a Huge Array for a while, you should compact the Huge Array with <CODE>
HugeArrayCompressBlocks</CODE>
 (see <A HREF="#VM_1a.htm_26236"> Huge Array Utilities</A>
).</P>
<P>
Ordinarily, VM Chains may not contain LMem heaps. Huge Arrays are an exception. The reason LMem blocks cannot belong to VM chains is simple. Each block in a VM chain begins with the handle of the next block in the chain (or VM_CHAIN_TREE if it is a tree block). However, each LMem heap has to begin with an <CODE>
LMemBlockHeader</CODE>
 structure, the first word of which is the global handle of the memory block. In order for these blocks to serve as both, special actions have to be taken. When a Huge Array block is unlocked, its first word is the handle of the next block in the chain. It is thus a VM chain block and not a valid LMem heap. When the Huge Array routine needs to access the block, it locks the block and copies the block's global handle into the first word, storing the chain link in another word. This makes the block a valid LMem heap, but it (temporarily) invalidates the VM chain.

</P>
<P>
Although VM chain utilities work on Huge Arrays, you must be sure that the Huge Array is a valid VM chain when you call the utility. In practice, this means you cannot use a VM chain utility when any block in the chain is locked or while any thread might be accessing the array. If more than one thread might be using the array, you should not use the chain utilities.</P>

Basic Huge Array Routines</H3>
<PRE>HugeArrayCreate(), HugeArrayDestroy(), HugeArrayResize(), HugeArrayLock(), HugeArrayUnlock(), HugeArrayDirty(), HugeArrayAppend(), Huge ArrayInsert(), HugeArrayReplace(), HugeArrayDelete(), HugeArrayGetCount()</PRE>
<P>
GEOS provides many routines for dealing with Huge Arrays. The basic routines are described in this section. Some additional routines which can help optimize your code are described in <A HREF="#VM_1a.htm_26236"> Huge Array Utilities</A>
.</P>
<P>
Note that you should never have more than one block of a Huge Array locked at a time. Furthermore, when you call any routine in this section (except <CODE>
HugeArrayUnlock()</CODE>
, <CODE>
HugeArrayDirty()</CODE>
, and <CODE>
HugeArrayGetCount()</CODE>
), you should not have <EM>
any</EM>
 blocks locked. The next section contains several routines which may be used while a block is locked. Also, if you use any VM chain routines on a Huge Array, you should make sure that no blocks are locked.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_19.htm_IX_HugeArrayCreate()">
 </A>
To create a Huge Array, call <CODE>
HugeArrayCreate()</CODE>
. This routine allocates a directory block and initializes it. The routine takes three arguments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The handle of the VM file in which to create the huge array. This argument is ignored if a default VM file has been set for this thread.</LI>
<LI>
The size of each element. A size of zero indicates that arguments will be variable-sized.</LI>
<LI>
The size to allocate for the directory block's header. If you want to have a fixed data area between the <CODE>
HugeArrayDirectory</CODE>
 structure and the chunk array of directory entries, you can pass an argument here. The size must be at least as large as <CODE>
sizeof(HugeArrayDirectory)</CODE>
. Alternatively, you can pass an argument of zero, indicating that there will be no extra data area, and the default header size should be used.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<CODE>
HugeArrayCreate()</CODE>
 returns the VM handle of the directory block. This is also the handle of the Huge Array itself; you will pass it as an argument to most of the other Huge Array routines.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_19.htm_IX_HugeArrayDestroy()">
 </A>
When you are done with a Huge Array, destroy it by calling <CODE>
HugeArrayDestroy()</CODE>
. This routine frees all of the blocks in the Huge Array. It takes two arguments, namely the global handle of the VM file and the VM handle of the Huge Array. It does not return anything. You should make sure that none of the data blocks are locked when you call this since all of the VM chain links must be valid when this routine is called.

</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_19.htm_IX_HugeArrayLock()">
 </A>
To access an element in the array, call <CODE>
HugeArrayLock()</CODE>
. This routine takes five arguments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The global handle of the VM file which contains the Huge Array. </LI>
<LI>
The VM handle of the Huge Array.</LI>
<LI>
The (32-bit) index number of the element.</LI>
<LI>
A pointer to a pointer to an element.</LI>
<LI>
A pointer to a word-sized variable.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The routine figures out which block has the element specified (as described above). It then locks that block. It writes a pointer to that element in the location passed, and writes the size of the element in the variable pointed to by the other pointer (this is useful if the Huge Array has variable-sized elements). It returns a dword. The more significant word is the number of consecutive elements in that block, starting with the pointer returned; the less significant word is the number of elements in that block before (and including) the element specified. For example, suppose you lock element 1,000. Let's assume that this element is in block <EM>
x</EM>
; block <EM>
x</EM>
 has 50 elements, and element 1,000 in the huge array is the 30th element in block <EM>
x</EM>
. The routine would write a pointer to element 1,000 in the pointer passed; it would then return the dword 0x0015001e. The upper word (0x0015) indicates that element 1,000 is the first of the last 21 consecutive elements in the block; the lower word (0x001e) indicates that the element is the last of the first 30 consecutive elements. You thus know which other elements in the Huge Array are in this block and can be examined without further calls to <CODE>
HugeArrayLock()</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_19.htm_IX_HugeArrayUnlock()">
 </A>
When you are done examining a block in the Huge Array, you should unlock the block with <CODE>
HugeArrayUnlock()</CODE>
. This routine takes only one argument, namely a pointer to any element in that block. It does not return anything. Note that you don't have to pass it the same pointer as the one you were given by <CODE>
HugeArrayLock()</CODE>
. Thus, you can get a pointer, increment it to work your way through the block, and unlock the block with whatever address you end up with.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_19.htm_IX_HugeArrayDirty()">
 </A>
Whenever you insert or delete an element, the Huge Array routines automatically mark the relevant blocks as dirty. However, if you change an element, you need to dirty the block yourself or the changes won't be saved to the disk. To do this, call the routine <CODE>
HugeArrayDirty()</CODE>
. This routine takes one argument, namely a pointer to an element in a Huge Array. It dirties the data block containing that element. Naturally, if you change several elements in a block, you only need to call this routine once.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_19.htm_IX_HugeArrayAppend()">
 </A>
If you want to add elements to the end of a Huge Array, call <CODE>
HugeArrayAppend()</CODE>
. If elements are of uniform size, you can add up to 
2<small><sup>16</sup></small>
elements with one call to this routine. You can also pass a pointer to a template element; it will copy the template into each new element it creates. This routine takes four arguments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The global handle of the VM file containing the Huge Array. This argument is ignored if a default file has been set.</LI>
<LI>
The VM handle of the Huge Array.</LI>
<LI>
The number of elements to append, if the elements are of uniform size; or the size of the element to append, if elements are of variable size.</LI>
<LI>
An optional pointer to a buffer containing initialization data for the new element(s).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The routine returns the index of the new element. If several elements were created, it returns the index of the first of the new elements. This index is a dword.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_19.htm_IX_HugeArrayInsert()">
 </A>
You can also insert one or more elements in the middle of a Huge Array. To do this, call the routine <CODE>
HugeArrayInsert()</CODE>
. As with <CODE>
HugeArrayAppend()</CODE>
, you can insert many uniform-sized elements at once, and you can pass a pointer to a template to initialize elements with. The routine takes five arguments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The global handle of the VM file containing the Huge Array. This argument is ignored if a default file has been set.</LI>
<LI>
The VM handle of the Huge Array.</LI>
<LI>
The number of elements to insert, if the elements are of uniform size; or the size of the element to insert, if elements are of variable size.</LI>
<LI>
The index of the first of the new elements (the element that currently has that index will follow the inserted elements).</LI>
<LI>
A pointer to a template element to copy into each new element (pass a null pointer to leave the elements uninitialized).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
It returns the index of the first of the new elements. Ordinarily, this will be the index you passed it; however, if you pass an index which is out of bounds, the new elements will be put at the end of the array, and the index returned will thus be different.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_19.htm_IX_HugeArrayDelete()">
 </A>
To delete elements in a Huge Array, call <CODE>
HugeArrayDelete()</CODE>
. You can delete many elements (whether uniform-sized or variable-sized) with one call to <CODE>
HugeArrayDelete()</CODE>
. The routine takes four arguments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The global handle of the VM file containing the Huge Array. This argument is ignored if a default file has been set.</LI>
<LI>
The VM handle of the Huge Array.</LI>
<LI>
The number of elements to delete.</LI>
<LI>
The index of the first element to delete.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_19.htm_IX_HugeArrayResize()">
 </A>
You can resize one of the elements by calling <CODE>
HugeArrayResize()</CODE>
. If you make the element smaller, then data at the end will be truncated. If you make the element larger, then the new data will be zero-initialized.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_19.htm_IX_HugeArrayReplace()">
 </A>
You can erase or replace the data in one or more elements with a call to <CODE>
HugeArrayReplace()</CODE>
. This is also the only way to resize a variable-sized element. You can pass a pointer to a template to copy into the element or elements, or you can have the element(s) initialized with null bytes. The routine takes five arguments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The global handle of the VM file containing the Huge Array. This argument is ignored if a default file has been set.</LI>
<LI>
The VM handle of the Huge Array.</LI>
<LI>
The number of elements to replace, if the elements are uniform-sized; or the new size for the element, if elements are variable-sized.</LI>
<LI>
The index of the first of the elements to replace.</LI>
<LI>
A pointer to a template element to copy into each new element (pass a null pointer to fill the elements with null bytes).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_19.htm_IX_HugeArrayGetCount()">
 </A>
You can find out the number of elements in a Huge Array with a call to <CODE>
HugeArrayGetCount()</CODE>
. This routine takes two arguments, namely the file handle and the handle of the Huge Array. The routine returns the number of elements in the array. Since array indices begin at zero, if <CODE>
HugeArrayGetCount()</CODE>
 returns <em>x</em>, the last element in the array has index 
<em>x</em>-1.</P>

<P>
The routines in the other section may be all you will need for using Huge Arrays. However, you can improve access time by taking advantage of the structure of a Huge Array. As noted above, you can use any of the VM Chain routines on a Huge Array, as long as none of the blocks are locked. </P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_1a.htm_IX_HugeArrayNext()">
 </A>
If you have been accessing an element in a Huge Array and you want to move
on to the next one, you can call the routine <CODE>HugeArrayNext()</CODE>.
The routine takes a pointer to a pointer to the element. It changes that
pointer to point to the next element in the array, which may be in a
different block. If the routine changes blocks, it will unlock the old block
and lock the next one. It returns the number of consecutive elements starting
with the element we just advanced to. If we were at the last element in the
Huge Array, it returns zero and the pointer will point to the last element.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_1a.htm_IX_HugeArrayPrev()">
 </A>
If you want to move to the previous element instead of the next one, call
<CODE>HugeArrayPrev()</CODE>. It also takes a pointer to a pointer to an
element. It changes that pointer to a pointer to the previous element; if
this means switching blocks, it unlocks the current block and locks the
previous one. It returns the number of elements which come before the
newly-locked one in its block, counting the newly-locked element. If the
pointer was pointing to the first element in the Huge Array, it returns
zero and the pointer will point to the first element.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_1a.htm_IX_HugeArrayExpand()">
 </A>
If you have a block of the Huge Array locked and you want to insert an element or elements at an address in that block, call the routine <CODE>
HugeArrayExpand()</CODE>
. It takes three arguments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
A pointer to a pointer to the location where we you want to insert the elements. This element must be in a locked block.</LI>
<LI>
The number of elements to insert, if the elements are uniform-sized; or the size of the element to insert, if elements are variable-sized.</LI>
<LI>
A pointer to a template to copy into each new element. If you pass a null pointer, elements will not be initialized.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The routine inserts the elements, dirtying any appropriate blocks. It writes a pointer to the first new element into the pointer passed. Since the data block may be resized or divided to accommodate the request, this address may be different from the one you pass. The routine returns the number of consecutive elements beginning with the one whose address was written. If the new element is in a different block from the address passed, the old block will be unlocked, and the new one will be locked.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_1a.htm_IX_HugeArrayContract()">
 </A>
If you have a block of a Huge Array locked and you want to delete one or more elements starting with one within the block, you can call <CODE>
HugeArrayContract()</CODE>
. This routine takes two arguments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
A pointer to the first element to be deleted. The block with that element must be locked.</LI>
<LI>
The number of elements to delete. Not all of these elements need be in the same block as the first.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The routine deletes the elements, dirtying any appropriate blocks. It then changes the pointer to point to the first element after the deleted ones. If this element is in a different block, it will unlock the old block and lock the new one. It returns the number of consecutive elements following the one whose address was written.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_1a.htm_IX_HugeArrayEnum()">
 </A>
You may wish to perform the same operation on a number of consecutive elements of a Huge Array. <CODE>
HugeArrayEnum()</CODE>
 is a routine which lets you do this efficiently. <CODE>
HugeArrayEnum()</CODE>
 takes six arguments:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The VMFileHandle of the VM file containing the Huge Array.</LI>
<LI>
The VMBlockHandle of the Huge Array.</LI>
<LI>
The index of the first element to be enumerated (remember, the first element has index zero).</LI>
<LI>
The number of elements to enumerate, or -1 to enumerate to the end of the array.</LI>
<LI>
A void pointer; this pointer will be passed to the callback routine.</LI>
<LI>
A void pointer to a Boolean callback routine. This callback routine should take two arguments: a void pointer to an element and the void pointerthat was passed to <CODE>
HugeArrayEnum()</CODE>
. The callback routine can abort the enumeration by returning <EM>
true</EM>
 (<EM>
i.e.</EM>
, non-zero).</LI>
</UL>
<P>
<CODE>
HugeArrayEnum()</CODE>
 calls the callback routine for every element, in order, from the first element. It passes the callback a pointer to the element and the pointer passed to <CODE>
HugeArrayEnum()</CODE>
. The callback routine may not do anything which would invalidate any pointers to the Huge Array; for example, it may not allocate, delete, or resize any of the elements. The callback routine should restrict itself to examining elements and altering them (<EM>
without</EM>
 resizing them). The callback routine can abort the enumeration by returning <EM>
true</EM>
 (<EM>
i.e.</EM>
, non-zero); if it does so, <CODE>
HugeArrayEnum()</CODE>
 will return <EM>
true</EM>

HugeArrayEnum()</CODE>
 finishes the enumeration without aborting, it returns <EM>
false</EM>

<P>
If the count is large enough to take <CODE>
HugeArrayEnum()</CODE>
 past the end of the array, <CODE>
HugeArrayEnum()</CODE>
 will simply enumerate up to the last element, then stop. For example, if you pass a start index of 9,000 and a count of 2,000, but the Huge Array has only 10,000 elements, <CODE>
HugeArrayEnum()</CODE>
 will enumerate up through the last element (with index 9,999) then stop. However, the starting index <EM>
must</EM>
 be the index of an element in the Huge Array. You can also pass a count of -1, indicatingg that <CODE>
HugeArrayEnum()</CODE>
 should enumerate through the last element of the array. Therefore, to enumerate the entire array, pass a starting element of zero and a count of -1.<A NAME="VM_1a.htm_marker=377703">

As noted above, most Huge Arrays contain a fair amount of unused space. This makes it much faster to add and remove elements, since blocks don't need to be resized very often. However, if you have a Huge Array that is not frequently changed, this is an inefficient use of space. You can free this space by calling <CODE>
HugeArrayCompressBlocks()</CODE>
. This routine is passed two arguments: the handle of the VM file, and the <CODE>
VMBlockHandle</CODE>
 of the Huge Array. The routine does not change any element in the Huge Array; it simply resizes the directory and data blocks to be no larger than necessary to hold their elements. The routine does not return anything.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VM_1a.htm_IX_ECCheckHugeArray()">
 </A>
If you want to verify (in error-checking code) that a given VM block is the directory block of a Huge Array, you can call <CODE>
ECCheckHugeArray()</CODE>
. This routine is passed the VM file and block handles of the block in question. If the block is the directory block of a Huge Array, the routine returns normally; otherwise it causes a fatal error. The routine should not, therefore, be used in non-EC code.</P>
