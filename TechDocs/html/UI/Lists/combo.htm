List Object Features</H2>
<P>
The list objects provide a highly flexible way to display and manage user-selectable options. Depending on the Specific UI and the type of list, these objects may be built out in a variety of fashions. In some UIs, BooleanGroups may appear as checkboxes, GenItemGroups may appear as radio buttons, etc. </P>
<P>
You may manipulate the grouping objects in much the same way as a GIV_SUB_GROUP GenInteraction. For example, hints may alter the placement and dimensions of the grouping object's children or the list may appear with special dimensions. The items themselves are simple generic objects that can be easily added to your grouping object. The grouping object will manage the geometry and selection state of these children; it will also perform any required actions based on the state of these children.
<IMG SRC="Lists.1.listDumps.gif">

</P>
<P>
There are three list management objects. </P>
<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>
GenItemGroup<BR>
</CODE>
An all-purpose grouping object, this list may be exclusive (only one item may be selected at a time) or non-exclusive and may also have scroll bars. A GenItemGroup may only contain <CODE>
GenItemClass</CODE>
 objects as its children.</LI>
<LI>
<CODE>
GenBooleanGroup<BR>
</CODE>
This list is designed for entries that are either true of false (&quot;on&quot; or &quot;off&quot;) independent of other entries. The BooleanGroup keeps track of its selections with a bitfield representing the boolean state of each of its children. A GenBooleanGroup object may only contain <CODE>
GenBooleanClass</CODE>
 objects.</LI>
<LI>
<CODE>
GenDynamicList<BR>
</CODE>
This list is designed for very long or changing length lists. In many respects it is similar to a GenItemGroup but also allows efficient dynamic lists. A GenDynamicList does not specify any explicit &quot;children&quot;; instead it contains a list of monikers to display to the user within a scrolling list.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
These are the following main list item objects:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>
GenItem<BR>
</CODE>
Objects used as entries in a GenItemGroup. In OSF/Motif, these objects appear in most cases as &quot;diamond&quot; settings.</LI>
<LI>
<CODE>
GenBoolean<BR>
</CODE>
Objects used as entries in a GenBooleanGroup representing true or false states. In OSF/Motif, these items appear most often as selectable &quot;boxes.&quot;</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The GenDynamicList does not specify any generic children, but instead will contain a list of visual monikers to cycle through a scrolling list.</P>

<H2 CLASS="sectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">The List Objects</A>: 2 
Common Behavior</H2>
<P>
Each list object acts differently and you will need to carefully review these differences before using them. There are a number of similarities in the functionality of these list objects, however. This next section details these similarities.</P>
<P>
Each list group acts as a grouping object for its generic children. The list groups have much of the same geometry capabilities as a GIV_SUB_GROUP Interaction; they can arrange their children in a variety of fashions and can also be manipulated within their parent.</P>
<P>
The items themselves may in general be either &quot;on&quot; (selected) or &quot;off&quot; (unselected). Depending on the behavior of the list, selecting an item may cause an action to occur and may affect the other selections. In exclusive lists, for example, selecting any item deselects any other item. </P>
<P CLASS="subsectionLink">
<A HREF="#Lists_3.htm">Applying the Action</A></P>
<P CLASS="subsectionLink">
<A HREF="#Lists_4.htm">State Information</A></P>
<HR>
<A NAME="Lists_3.htm"></A>


<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">The List Objects</A>: 2.1 <A HREF="#Lists_2.htm">Common Behavior</A>: 
Applying the Action</H3>
<P>
Often, each list object will contain an &quot;apply&quot; message. This message will be sent out when the list's state has changed and the new state should be applied in the application. For example, a list of colors (&quot;Red&quot;, &quot;Green&quot;, and &quot;Blue&quot;) may have a message <CODE>
MSG_GEN_VIEW_SET_COLOR</CODE>
 that sets the background color of a GenView. Changing the state of the list (by selecting an item) will cause this notification message to be sent to the view. More typically, though, the apply message will be sent to the application or a controller object.</P>
<P>
Alternatively, you could forego including an apply message in the list object's instance data. In this case, whenever the object receives a <CODE>
MSG_GEN_APPLY</CODE>
 it would query the state of its children and act upon that state.</P>
<P>
When the user makes a selection, the apply action may or may not be sent out immediately, depending on the operating mode of the list. GenItemGroups, GenBooleanGroups, and GenDynamicLists may operate in one of two modes: immediate or delayed. (For a more complete discussion of delayed and immediate modes, see <A HREF="../../UI/GenInteraction/index.htm">the GenInteractionClass chapter</A>.) Typically, a list object will operate in delayed mode if it is placed within a GIT_PROPERTIES Interaction. Other generic objects such as GenInteractions, GenTexts, and GenValues also utilize delayed and immediate mode.</P><P>
In immediate mode, any changes made in the list's state are reflected immediately in the application. If the user changes an immediate mode list object concerning a text style change, the text style of the current selection will change immediately. Changing the state of the list will cause the apply action associated with that object to be sent out immediately.</P>
<P>
In delayed mode, any changes made in the list's state are not reflected until some later time, when the changes are &quot;applied.&quot; This apply may be effected by the user (through an &quot;apply&quot; trigger) or by the application when it deems it appropriate. In delayed mode, the notification message will not be sent on changes to the state of the list but only when the list receives notice to apply the changes.</P>
<P>
Occasionally, a list operating in delayed mode may wish to send out a different message whenever the user changes its state, even if that change should not be immediately applied. In this case, you can supply a status message for the object to send to the destination whenever the user makes changes within the list group.</P>
<P>
Each list must have a destination to send its apply action and, if needed, status messages to. This destination can be any object or process capable of handling the message. </P>
<HR>
<A NAME="Lists_4.htm"></A>


<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">The List Objects</A>: 2.2 <A HREF="#Lists_2.htm">Common Behavior</A>: 
State Information</H3>
<P>
In most cases, a selection will be either on or off. In some cases, however, a selection or a list's state will be indeterminate--considered neither completely on or off. For example, a styles list may show the characteristics of the current highlighted text (bold, italic, underlined, etc.). Selecting a whole paragraph of text in which only one word is bold will leave the &quot;bold&quot; entry in the styles list in an indeterminate state--some of the selected text is bold, some is not. </P>
<P>
The lists keep track of these indeterminate states themselves. In some cases, an entire list may be indeterminate; in other cases, individual items may be indeterminate. It is up to the specific UI to represent an indeterminate state. (In OSF/Motif settings that are indeterminate are shown unselected.)</P>
<P>
If a list object is operating in delayed mode, changes within the list will not be effected until either the user or the application &quot;applies&quot; them. The list objects keep track of changes in state by storing a modified state of either the list or individual items. Whenever an apply action is made on a list group, the group will check whether its list (or its items) have been modified. If nothing has been marked modified, the list will not apply those changes (unless you wish to override this default behavior).</P>
<P>
This modified state is independent of the list's mode. In immediate mode, a change in state to a list object will automatically mark that list object modified and simultaneously call <CODE>
MSG_GEN_APPLY</CODE>
 on the list object. The list object will recognize that it is modified and will send out the group's apply action. In delayed mode, any changes made to the object will also mark the group modified; at some later point, <CODE>
MSG_GEN_APPLY</CODE>
 will be sent to the list; the object will recognize that the group has been modified and will then send out its apply action.</P>

<H2 CLASS="sectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">The List Objects</A>: 3 
GenItemGroups</H2>
<P>
The <CODE>
GenItemGroupClass</CODE>
 and <CODE>
GenItemClass</CODE>
 work together to allow an application to set up a list of options for a user to choose. A GenItemGroup may contain one or more GenItems; each GenItem may represent a particular option in the list. The user may select one or more of the options at any time, depending upon the behavior specified for the list, and the user can generally select or deselect an option by activating the corresponding GenItem.</P>
<P>
<CODE>
GenItemClass</CODE>
 objects are simple list items. GenItems are used only as entries within a GenItemGroup. In most cases, a GenItem will only need a moniker and a special identifier associated with the selection. The GenItemGroup will use this identifier to refer to the object when it needs to communicate to the items or when it sends out messages. </P>
<P>
Your application interacts with GenItems though the GenItemGroup; this group controls the items and keeps track of which are selected. The GenItemGroup object has all of the same geometry features as a grouping type GenInteraction.

GenItemGroup Behavior</H4>
<PRE>GIGI_behaviorType, MSG_GEN_ITEM_GROUP_SET_BEHAVIOR_TYPE, MSG_GEN_ITEM_GROUP_GET_BEHAVIOR_TYPE</PRE>
<P>
There are several types of user selection behavior for a GenItemGroup. Items can be set up so that only one is selected at a time, one or none is selected at a time, multiple items can be selected, or multiple items can be selected only when extending the selection (e.g. dragging the mouse).</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Lists_8.htm_IX_GIGI_behaviorType">
 </A>
The GIGI_<CODE>
behaviorType</CODE>
 instance field defines the selection behavior of the list. The instance data must be of the enumerated type <CODE>
GenItemGroupBehaviorType</CODE>
<A NAME="Lists_8.htm_IX_GenItemGroupBehaviorType">
 </A>
. The default type is GIGBT_EXCLUSIVE, which creates an exclusive list; one and only one selection in an exclusive list may be selected at any time. The available types are listed below.</P>
<DL>
<DT>
GIGBT_EXCLUSIVE</DT><DD>
<A NAME="Lists_8.htm_IX_GIGBT_&ldots;">
 </A>
This is a list where only one option may be selected at a time. Once a selection has been made, making another selection will deselect the previous item. The user may not deselect a currently selected item. Many specific UIs represent these items with radio buttons; OSF/Motif represents these items with &quot;diamond&quot; settings. This type of list is the default for a GenItemGroup. </DD>
<DT>
GIGBT_EXCLUSIVE_NONE</DT><DD>
This list is also exclusive--at most one option may be selected at a time--but the user can also deselect an item, leaving no items selected. GenItemGroups show a &quot;none-selected&quot; state with GIGS_NONE in their GIGI_<CODE>
selection</CODE>
 instance fields.</DD>
<DT>
GIGBT_EXTENDED_SELECTION</DT><DD>
This list is normally exclusive, unless the user &quot;extends&quot; the selection. The user can extend the selection either by dragging the mouse through another selection or by clicking on a new selection in conjunction with a special keystroke. In OSF/Motif, clicking on an item while holding the SHIFT key will extend the selection (leaving any other selections unaffected) to the one clicked on. Extending a selection to a currently selected item will deselect that item.</DD>
<DT>
GIGBT_NON_EXCLUSIVE</DT><DD>
This list does not exhibit any exclusive behavior. Any or all settings may be on at any time, and selecting any items will not affect the state of other settings. In many case, you may want to use a GenBooleanGroup in place of a non-exclusive GenItemGroup. For example, a non-exclusive GenItemGroup cannot store individual indeterminate or modified states for its children; GenBooleanGroup stores this information.</DD>

</DL>
<H5 CLASS="HeadingD">
Exclusive Lists</H5>
<P>
<A NAME="Lists_8.htm_IX_Exclusive lists">
 </A>
Exclusive lists are designed for cases in which one and only item should be selected at any given time. For example, a graphics application may want to prompt the user to select a color for drawing lines. The application can display this list of colors within an exclusive list. Only one color may be selected. Once a color is selected, selecting any other color will deselect the first color.</P>
<P>
Exclusive lists may (and by default do) appear without any item initially selected. This may lead to problems if the application tries to apply any changes before an item is selected (such as within a delayed-mode dialog box). If your application needs an item to be selected at all times in order to operate correctly, your list should appear with one of the items initially selected (or with the &quot;apply&quot; trigger disabled).</P>


<H5 CLASS="HeadingD">
Exclusive-None Lists</H5>
<P>
Exclusive-None lists are designed for cases in which either one item must be selected or no items should be selected. For example, a word processor may have a &quot;Justifications&quot; menu with several options such as left-justified, right-justified, or center-justified. Selecting any of these options will perform the justification operation on the current paragraph, but the user may also deselect any option, leaving no justification on the paragraph.</P>
<P>
Exclusive-None lists by default appear without any items initially selected. Your application should, of course, be able to handle this case of nothing selected; if it cannot, the list should probably not be exclusive-none.</P>


<H5 CLASS="HeadingD">
Extended-Selection Lists</H5>
<P>
Extended-Selection lists are designed for cases in which the application usually needs an exclusive selection but also desires to let the user select multiple items for bulk operations. Multiple selections are stored as lists of items.</P>
<P>
For example, a disk copy operation may have an extended-selection list to specify the drive to copy a file to. In most cases, the user will only want to copy to one drive, and the list normally operates in exclusive mode to accommodate this. By extending the selection, however, the user can request the list to copy the file to multiple drives.</P>
<P>
It is up to the specific UI how the user may extend a selection. In OSF/Motif, the user may select another item in tandem with a special keystroke (the SHIFT key) to extend the selection from one item to several. Extending a selection to an already selected item will deselect that item, leaving any other items unchanged.</P>


<H5 CLASS="HeadingD">
<A NAME="Lists_8.htm_IX_Non-exclusive lists">
 </A>
Non-Exclusive Lists</H5>
<P>
Non-exclusive lists are designed for cases in which any or all of the items may be selected at once. Multiple selections, as in the extended-selection GenItemGroup, are stored as lists of items. Selecting an already selected item will deselect that item. Therefore, there may be a state where nothing is selected within a non-exclusive list.</P>
<P>
For example, an interactive tutorial may ask the user if he wants more information on certain topics, giving these topics in a non-exclusive list. The user can freely choose as many or as few items as he wishes, and then select &quot;Print&quot; to print out information on those items.</P>
<P>
In most cases, however, you might rather use a GenBooleanGroup object in place of a non-exclusive GenItemGroup. A GenBooleanGroup acts similar to a non-exclusive list but is streamlined to operate efficiently for lists with 16 or fewer items. (GenBooleanGroups represent their children's state through a word-length bitfield; therefore they may only accommodate 16 children.) You may also need to use a GenBooleanGroup if you need to keep track of individual indeterminate and modified states.</P>

Within a GenItemGroup, each GenItem must contain an identifier, often an enumerated value, to uniquely identify that item. The GenItemGroup will use this identifying value whenever referencing the GenItem (or items), either through its instance data or through messages. This value is stored in the GenItem's GII_<CODE>
identifier</CODE>
 instance data. </P>
<P>
In most cases, your collection of GenItems within a particular GenItemGroup should be different enumerated values. Each item within a specific GenItemGroup must have a unique identifier to reference each item. To ensure this, it is usually convenient to use an enumerated type. Make sure that you don't use two different enumerated types because they may not contain unique values across types.</P>
<P>

In an exclusive or exclusive-none list, the GenItemGroup will store the identifier of the current selection in the GIGI_<CODE>

<P>
The GIGI_<CODE>
stateFlags</CODE>
 contains flags relating to the state of the entire GenItemGroup. The two flags possible are</P>
<UL>
<LI>
GIGSF_INDETERMINATE<BR>
This flag marks the GenItemGroup indeterminate. Only the group may be indeterminate; individual GenItems may not be marked indeterminate.</LI>
<LI>
GIGSF_MODIFIED<BR>
This flag marks the GenItemGroup modified. Only the group may be marked as modified; individual GenItems may not be marked as modified.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
A GenItemGroup is in the indeterminate state if its GIGI_<CODE>
stateFlags</CODE>
 contains the GIGSF_INDETERMINATE flag. GenItems cannot be in an indeterminate state by themselves; either the entire list is indeterminate or it is not. If you want individual items to be indeterminate, you may want to use a GenBooleanGroup object instead.</P>
<P>
A GenItemGroup is in the modified state if its GIGI_<CODE>
stateFlags</CODE>
 contains the GIGSF_MODIFIED flag. GenItems may not be in a modified state by themselves; either the entire list is modified or it is not. If you want to mark individual items as modified, you may want to use a GenBooleanGroup object instead.</P>
<P>
In immediate mode, any user change to the GenItemGroup's state automatically sets the GIGSF_MODIFIED flag and also forces an &quot;apply.&quot; Therefore, in immediate mode, any user changes will, by default, cause the apply action to be sent out immediately. In delayed mode, the GIGSF_MODIFIED flag is set, but an apply action will not automatically occur. The apply action will only occur when the user forces it (such as clicking on an &quot;apply&quot; trigger) or when the application forces it (by sending out a <CODE>
MSG_GEN_APPLY</CODE>
).</P>
<P>
You can force an apply by sending the GenItemGroup <CODE>
MSG_GEN_APPLY</CODE>
. You can also override the default behavior, forcing the object to send out its notification message on all applies, by including <CODE>
ATTR_GEN_SEND_APPLY_MSG_ON_APPLY_EVEN_IF_NOT_MODIFIED</CODE>
 in the object's instance data. Any time the object receives an &quot;apply,&quot; the GenItemGroup will send out the notification message even if the object does not contain any modified GenItem children.</P>
<P>
In general, if the user makes redundant changes (such as repeatedly selecting the same item) the group will not be marked modified--the group has not changed state since the last apply, so there is no need to send out a notification message. If, however, you wish for the group to be set modified on redundant changes, add the vardata attribute ATTR_GEN_ITEM_GROUP_SET_MODIFIED_ON_REDUNDANT_SELECTION to the object's instance data. Whenever the user makes any selection, the group will be marked modified. </P>
<P>
To check whether a GenItemGroup is indeterminate, send it a <CODE>
MSG_GEN_ITEM_GROUP_IS_INDETERMINATE</CODE>

<P>
If you wish your application to receive notice whenever the list's state changes, even if those changes will not be immediately applied, you may set a status message in the object's instance data. </P>
<P>
For example, a color selection dialog box provides two means to set the RGB value of a color: one in a GenItemGroup listing the total possible states and another in a GenBooleanGroup with separate toggle states for Red, Green, and Blue. In delayed mode, setting the values in one group should change the display of the other group simultaneously but should not result in an apply action until the user activates the apply trigger. </P>
<P>
One list can notify its partner of state changes with a status message. The other list can respond to state changes (and therefore change its corresponding state) without actually applying those changes.</P>
<P>
To set up a status message, add a message based on the prototype GEN_ITEM_GROUP_STATUS_MSG. This message will be sent to the list's destination object. Set ATTR_GEN_ITEM_GROUP_STATUS_MSG to the status message.</P>

 </A>
A scrolling list is a special version of a GenItemGroup that allows the user to scroll through a list of items which are not all visible at one time. Scrolling lists usually provide scrollbars or some other means to quickly scan through a list. You may make a GenItemGroup scrollable if the specific UI allows by including the hint <CODE>
HINT_ITEM_GROUP_SCROLLABLE</CODE>
 in the list's object declaration.</P>
<P>
The list will come up in a standard size determined by the specific UI. You may override this by adding a size hint to the object (<CODE>
HINT_FIXED_SIZE</CODE>
, <CODE>
HINT_INITIAL_SIZE</CODE>
, etc.). Notification of changes for a scrolling list, as well as setting and getting the selections, works the same for a scrolling list as for a normal GenItemGroup. If an item is selected, the scrolling list will almost always scroll automatically to the selected item.</P>
<P>
To force a GenItemGroup to scroll to an item, send <CODE>
MSG_GEN_ITEM_GROUP_MAKE_ITEM_VISIBLE</CODE>
. Pass this message the identifier of the item to be made visible in the scrolling list. This message has no effect on a non-scrolling list.</P>
<P>
You may wish in some cases for a scrolling list to be for display only. If so, set the scrollable GenItemGroup's GI_<CODE>
attrs</CODE>
 instance data to include the flag GA_READ_ONLY. The user will be unable to interact with a display-only scrolling list (although, of course, the user will still be able to scroll through the list). </P>
<P>
If your scrolling list will have many settings or will often be dynamically updated, you should consider using a GenDynamicList instead.</P>

In some cases, geometry constraints interfere with functionality. For example, you may wish for &quot;nested&quot; GenItemGroup behavior.

Normal geometry constraints prevent this, as GenItemGroups may only contain GenItems as children.</P>

To enable this, you may set up each main section as a separate GenItemGroup with a single selection. Within each GenItemGroup, include a link to the next GenItemGroup with <CODE>
ATTR_GEN_ITEM_GROUP_LINK</CODE>
. Links should be circular; i.e., if three GenItemGroups should be linked, the first group should point to the second, the second to the third, and the third back to the first. The three linked GenItemGroups will act as one entity. If each GenItemGroup is exclusive, one group will select its single item child if selected and the other groups will deselect their children. </P>
<P>
These links work because you are allowed to &quot;select&quot; items that are not actually within a GenItemGroup. If an item not within the group is selected, any current selection will therefore be de-selected.</P>

<A HREF="#index.htm">The List Objects</A>: 3.7 <A HREF="#Lists_5.htm">GenItemGroups</A>: 
Limitations of the GenItemGroup</H3>
<P>
GenItemGroups may only have GenItems as children. Likewise, GenItems must always be generic children of a GenItemGroup object. There also is no capability to allow some items under a GenItemGroup object to be exclusive while others are non-exclusive. This can often be accomplished instead by making the list non-exclusive and clearing other items when necessary to create the exclusive behavior.</P>
<P>
In some cases, you may wish to store modified or indeterminate states for individual items rather than for only the whole group. In this case, you should probably use a GenBooleanGroup.</P>
<P>
For long lists of items or lists that may require frequent updating, you might wish to use a GenDynamicList instead.</P>
<HR>
<A NAME="Lists_d.htm"></A>


<H2 CLASS="sectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">The List Objects</A>: 4 
GenDynamicListClass</H2>
<P>
The <CODE>
GenDynamicListClass</CODE>
 is a subclass of <CODE>
GenItemGroupClass</CODE>
 that allows an application to pass monikers to the object as needed rather than specify a GenItem for each item in the list. In almost all cases, you will want a GenDynamicList to be a scrolling list so that not all of the list entries will be displayed at any given time. (You can, however, still choose to create a non-scrolling dynamic list.)</P>
<P>
The GenDynamicList displays a list of monikers; this list of monikers is usually in the form of a data chunk managed by some other (application-supplied) object. For each moniker the GenDynamicList wishes to display, it will send out a query message and the position of the moniker requested. The object handling the query message will return a pointer to the moniker and will draw the moniker within the GenDynamicList. In this way, monikers for a GenDynamicList are only drawn as needed.</P>
<P>
The dynamic list allows the following:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Long Lists<BR>
Very long lists can be stored by the application in any way it wants and as efficiently as possible. Because these lists are often scrolling lists, the UI is not cluttered up with a multitude of list entries. Only those within the scroller's bounds will be visually displayed.</LI>
<LI>
Dynamic Display of Data<BR>
Applications can easily create a scrolling list from arbitrarily organized data. As long as you provide a means to convert the data into the proper moniker format, you can use any data you wish for moniker entries. You can also dynamically access this data and update the list entries.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
An application specifies the number of items in the list and if desired can set up a custom size for the dynamic list. Whenever the object needs to display a moniker, it will query its destination for the visual moniker to display as an item in the list. At any time, the application can remove or add items from the dynamic list or change the total number of items and start with all new items. Because the list only queries for items as they become visible, it is more efficient than having to display a large number of entries in a long list.</P>
<P>
Since <CODE>
GenDynamicListClass</CODE>
 is a subclass of <CODE>
GenItemGroupClass</CODE>
, all of the same messages that are passed to GenItemGroups can be passed to GenDynamicList (except <CODE>
MSG_GEN_ITEM_GROUP_GET_ITEM_OPTR</CODE>
, which has no meaning for a GenDynamicList). The lists can be exclusive, exclusive-none, extended-selection, or non-exclusive. The user can select and deselect items depending on the behavior type, etc.</P>

<CODE>
GenDynamicListClass</CODE>
 inherits all of the instance fields of <CODE>

<PRE>@instance word GDLI_numItems = 0;

<P>
GDLI_<A NAME="Lists_e.htm_IX_GDLI_numItems">

<CODE>
numItems</CODE>
 stores the number of items in the dynamic list. This field should be set to the initial number of monikers needed within your GenDynamicList. If this value is initially unknown (i.e. is retrieved dynamically) then you should set this value after the number of items becomes known (using <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DYNAMIC_LIST_INITIALIZE</CODE>
). If this instance field is zero, no items will be drawn.</P>
<P>
GDLI_<A NAME="Lists_e.htm_IX_GDLI_queryMsg">
 </A>
<CODE>
queryMsg</CODE>
 stores the querying message that the dynamic list sends each time it needs to display an entry's moniker. (For example, when initially realized, a scrolling dynamic list may display only four out of 16 entries; this message will be sent out four times to retrieve the monikers for the items initially displayable.) </P>
<P>
The query message will be handled by whatever object you set in <CODE>
GIGI_destination</CODE>

Note that this list of data will serve as the GenDynamicList's &quot;children&quot;; there are no GenItems allowed as children of a GenDynamicList. The query message is based on the prototype <CODE>

You will need to perform several preparatory steps in order to use a GenDynamicList object, even in its most basic form. The following steps are required for all dynamic lists.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Create a GenDynamicList object. You must include the number of items to appear in your list (or set them dynamically when this number is known) and a query message to handle the extraction and display of monikers from a list of data.</LI>
<LI>
Create a list of data to use as entries in the list. For simplicity, this can be a chunk of data containing a list of visual monikers, although the data may come from any source--as long as you provide the means to convert the data into monikers. </LI>
<LI>
Create a query message handler to search through the list of data. This handler should convert any data into a proper format (if necessary) and send the moniker to the dynamic list to display the item. You can convert the data into a proper format by using one of several messages provided with <CODE>
GenDynamicListClass</CODE>
. These messages may take text strings, visual monikers, or other forms of data to set the monikers for the dynamic list.</LI>
</UL>
<P CLASS="figTitle">

<P>
When a dynamic list is first built, the specific UI will decide how many items within the scrolling list should be initially displayed. For each of these items, the dynamic list will send out a query message, passing the number (position) of the item to search for. The querying message will search through a list of data (either custom or pre-existing), extracting and converting the data into text, graphics strings, or visual monikers, etc.</P>
<P>
Finally, your query message handler should set each moniker in the list using one of the <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DYNAMIC_LIST_REPLACE_ITEM_MONIKER</CODE>
 messages. There are three messages to set the moniker of a dynamic list entry:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>
MSG_GEN_DYNAMIC_LIST_REPLACE_ITEM_MONIKER<BR>
</CODE>
This is a general purpose moniker replacement message. It can take a variety of source types (optrs, fptrs, hptrs), data types (visMonikers, text strings, graphics strings, or even geode tokens), and (in the case of graphics strings) the height and width of the moniker. This message also provides a flag allowing a moniker entry to appear visually disabled (grayed out in OSF/Motif).</LI>
<LI>
<CODE>
MSG_GEN_DYNAMIC_LIST_REPLACE_ITEM_MONIKER_OPTR<BR>
</CODE>
This is a simplified version of the above message which takes a visual moniker and displays it within the dynamic list. The message's only arguments are the item in the list to update and the optr of the moniker for that item.</LI>
<LI>
<CODE>
MSG_GEN_DYNAMIC_LIST_REPLACE_ITEM_TEXT<BR>
</CODE>
This is another simplified version of the first message which takes a text string and displays it within the dynamic list. The message's only arguments are the item in the list to update and a pointer to the text string to use.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The simpler messages are useful if your data is a list of complete visual moniker structures or is a list of text strings. If you need to retrieve special data (such as GStrings or geode tokens), or if you need to perform special operations on the moniker (such as bringing it up disabled), then you must use <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DYNAMIC_LIST_REPLACE_ITEM_MONIKER</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
The data itself may be placed in several areas of your code. If the data is simple text strings, set up within an array, it may appear within the dynamic list's object block, its own resource block, or within the handler for the query message. If the data is visual monikers, the data must appear within a resource block. </P>
<P>
If the data is within a different block from the dynamic list, that block must be locked before its data can be accessed. Make sure to unlock the block after using the data.</P>

 provides a list of items (GenBoolean objects) that may be individually set regardless of the state of other items in the list.

Unlike a non-exclusive GenItemGroup, however, GenBooleanGroup also allows your application to keep track of individual states for each item.</P>
<P>
The GenBooleanGroup uses a word of data (16 bits) to keep track of the various states of its GenBoolean children. As a result, the maximum number of children allowed for a GenBooleanGroup object is 16.
