GenInteraction is a high-level object which manages groups of other generic objects. These groups of objects can appear as part of a window, as their own menu or even as a separate dialog box. <CODE>
GenInteractionClass </CODE>
also provides the means to interpret actions of its children and adjust the behavior of the Interaction accordingly. Therefore, it is meaningless for an Interaction to appear without children to manage. </P>
<P>
<CODE>
GenInteractionClass</CODE>
 is a subclass of <CODE>
GenClass</CODE>
 and therefore inherits all of its functionality. Of special interest for GenInteractions is geometry management with hints provided in <CODE>
GenClass</CODE>
. See <A HREF="../../SysObjects/Gen/index.htm">the GenClass chapter</A>and <A HREF="../../UI/Geometry/index.htm">the Managing UI Geometry chapter</A>for more information.</P>
<P>
You should be familiar with generic objects before reading this chapter. Please see <A HREF="../../UI/UIOverview/index.htm">the UI Overview</A>for an summary of each generic object in the user interface. You should be particularly familiar with the instance data of and messages handled by <CODE>
GenClass</CODE>

GenInteraction Features</H2>
<P>
Because of the nature of <CODE>
GenInteractionClass</CODE>
, objects of this class may appear in a variety of forms. The specific UI will have some control over the visual presentation of GenInteractions, but your application can usually specify in what manner the Interaction should appear. Your application may also add hints to the specific UI to modify the arrangement of objects within the Interaction.</P>
<P>
GenInteraction provides three main visual implementations:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
A sub-group, having no inherent visual representation at all. (The visual implementation depends on the Interaction's parent.)</LI>
<LI>
A popup (typically a menu) remaining hidden from the application until activated, and then normally only remaining on-screen for the duration of the selection. </LI>
<LI>
An independently displayable window (dialog box) coming on-screen whenever activated and going off-screen whenever instructed to.</LI>
<LI>
Popout dialog boxes which can act as sub-group GenInteractions (for example a menu bar) that can be &quot;popped out&quot; into dialog boxes. Note that popouts are not related to pop-ups.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Specifically, a GenInteraction also provides the following features:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
organization of the spacial arrangement of other objects.</LI>
<LI>
the capability to apply properties within an Interaction either immediately (in immediate mode) or at a later time (in delayed mode).</LI>
<LI>
the display of progress reports on the state of a process or object.</LI>
<LI>
the ability to initiate commands.</LI>
<LI>
several default dialog boxes for notification and affirmation responses.</LI>
<LI>
modal dialog boxes that block other threads of execution until responded to.</LI>
</UL>

<A HREF="#index.htm">Menus and Dialog Boxes</A>: 1.1 <A HREF="#Menus_1.htm">GenInteraction Features</A>: 
Sub-Group Interactions</H3>
<P>
A sub-group Interaction is the simplest manifestation of a GenInteraction. A sub-group may only appear as part of a larger window. You will most often use sub-group Interactions to arrange and group other objects (the Interaction's children) within proper places in the UI. This grouping is also sometimes useful to perform geometry actions upon and otherwise manipulate a group of objects as a whole. Using Interactions eliminates the need to provide individual requirements to each child object.
<IMG SRC="Menus_2_subgroupDump.gif">

</P>
<P>
For example, you can use the hint <CODE>
HINT_ORIENT_CHILDREN_VERTICALLY</CODE>
 on a single GenInteraction object to display its children in a vertical row. The Interaction's only function in this case is to provide an object for the hint to act upon. Interactions of this type may contain any number and type of children. Because they are not independently displayable, however, their use becomes limited to the constraints of the larger window. If you need the Interaction's children to be hidden from view until needed, you should use a popup or dialog Interaction.</P>

<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">Menus and Dialog Boxes</A>: 1.2 <A HREF="#Menus_1.htm">GenInteraction Features</A>: 
Popup Interactions (Menus)</H3>
<P>
A popup is an Interaction that you can use to contain commands or selections that should only be displayed when the popup itself is activated. A popup usually conceals its children from view until needed, therefore avoiding cluttering up the UI with dozens of objects at any given time. Popups are most often implemented as menus. Popups usually only remain on-screen until either a selection within the popup is made or the user activates some other object. Menus in OSF/Motif, for example, will only remain on-screen until an object in the menu is selected or until the user clicks somewhere else in the application. (GEOS' implementation of OSF/Motif does allow popups to be pinned, however.)
<IMG SRC="Menus_3_popupDump.gif">

</P>
<P>
Popups are not independently displayable; they must appear as part of another window. The popup Interaction's visual moniker usually serves as the only visual cue to the existence of the menu until it is activated. These menu titles usually appear in an appropriate menu bar of the window.</P>
<HR>
<A NAME="Menus_4.htm"></A>


<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">Menus and Dialog Boxes</A>: 1.3 <A HREF="#Menus_1.htm">GenInteraction Features</A>: 
Dialog Boxes</H3>
<P>
A dialog box is an Interaction that takes the form of an independently displayable window. Typically, a dialog box is a temporary window brought up by the application to request information from the user. Dialogs differ from Primary and Document windows in several ways, however. (For example, most dialogs are not resizable.) 
<IMG SRC="Menus_4_dialogDump.gif">

</P>
<P>
A dialog box can be in either of two conditions: modal or non-modal. By default, dialog boxes are non-modal. A modal dialog box is one in which all other input to the application is blocked until the user responds to the dialog. You will usually need modal dialog boxes when an application must gain some further information before proceeding. For example, many of the System Preferences dialog boxes are modal to prevent the user from changing other aspects of the system while these dialogs are up.</P>
<P>
Dialog boxes come on-screen either through direct user activation or through the application's instigation. By default, a dialog box will usually have an associated trigger object placed within the UI. This trigger's only function is to allow the user to bring the dialog box on-screen. You may remove this default activation trigger if your application code should bring up the dialog box instead.</P>

<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">Menus and Dialog Boxes</A>: 1.4 <A HREF="#Menus_1.htm">GenInteraction Features</A>: 
PopOuts</H3>
<P>
A popout GenInteraction is really just a grouping object that exists as either a simple sub-group or as a dialog box. Popouts generally begin life as sub-groups but can be &quot;popped out&quot; into dialog boxes that can be repositioned wherever the user wishes them. The dialog boxes can also be popped back into their sub-group arrangement.</P>
<P>
In general, the GenInteraction is either popped-out or popped-in by double-clicking within the Interaction bounds.

<P>
HINT_INTERACTION_FREQUENT_USAGE indicates that the GenInteraction is frequently used, and the specific UI may alter default functionality to reflect this. In most cases, this prevents dialog boxes from being automatically dismissed when the user is done interacting with them.<A NAME="Menus_6.htm_IX_HINT_INTERACTION_FREQUENT_USAGE">
 </A>
</P>
<P>
HINT_INTERACTION_INFREQUENT_USAGE<A NAME="Menus_6.htm_IX_HINT_INTERACTION_INFREQUENT_USAGE">
 </A>
 indicates that the GenInteraction is infrequently used. In some specific UIs, this prevents sub-menus from automatically cascading.</P>
<P>
HINT_INTERACTION_MAKE_RESIZABLE<A NAME="Menus_6.htm_IX_HINT_INTERACTION_MAKE_RESIZABLE">
 </A>
 indicates that this GenInteraction may be resized even if it not normally allowed to do so. This hint usually only applies to dialog boxes.</P>
<P>
HINT_INTERACTION_CANNOT_BE_DEFAULT<A NAME="Menus_6.htm_IX_HINT_INTERACTION_CANNOT_BE_DEFAULT">
 </A>
 indicates that this GenInteraction should not be activated as a system default. This hint prevents children of this GenInteraction from being activated as system defaults also. You should use this hint to mark groups of objects that may be potentially destructive; the user will be prevented from accidentally activating any objects in the GenInteraction.</P>
<P>
HINT_INTERACTION_MODAL<A NAME="Menus_6.htm_IX_HINT_INTERACTION_MODAL">
 </A>
 indicates that this GenInteraction (a dialog box) should be application modal. This hint should be used in place of GIA_MODAL in cases where modality is not needed for functionality, but is needed to present a cleaner UI to the user. Ideally, you should be able to go back and remove these hints by reworking the UI at some later time.</P>
<P>
HINT_INTERACTION_NO_DISTURB<A NAME="Menus_6.htm_IX_HINT_INTERACTION_NO_DISTURB">
 </A>
 indicates that this GenInteraction, if initiated, should be brought on-screen without disturbing the focus of the application. Usually, this hint is placed on notification type dialog boxes (such as new-mail notifications) so that the dialog box doesn't irritate the user by drawing away the focus.</P>
<P>
HINT_INTERACTION_DEFAULT_ACTION_IS_NAVIGATE_TO_NEXT_FIELD<A NAME="Menus_6.htm_IX_HINT_INTERACTION_DEFAULT_ACTION_IS_NAVIGATE_TO_NEXT_FIELD">
 </A>
 indicates that the default action for this Interaction group is to navigate to the next field. If something activates the GenInteraction's default action (for example by double-clicking within its confines) objects within the Interaction will not be activated; the focus will travel to the next field.</P>
<P>
HINT_CUSTOM_SYS_MENU<A NAME="Menus_6.htm_IX_HINT_CUSTOM_SYS_MENU">
 </A>
 indicates that this GenInteraction menu is a custom system menu. Depending on the specific UI, the standard system menu will be added as a sub-menu of the custom system menu. This hint takes an integer value that specifies the child position to place the standard system menu (0 being the first position).</P>
<P>
HINT_INTERACTION_MAXIMIZABLE<A NAME="Menus_6.htm_IX_HINT_INTERACTION_MAXIMIZABLE">
 </A>
 indicates that this GenInteraction should be maximizable. This hint also allows the GenInteraction to become restorable to its non-maximizable state.</P>
<P>
HINT_INTERACTION_POPOUT_HIDDEN_ON_STARTUP<A NAME="Menus_6.htm_IX_HINT_INTERACTION_POPOUT_HIDDEN_ON_STARTUP">

<P>
<CODE>
HINT_INTERACTION_DISCARD_WHEN_CLOSED</CODE>
<A NAME="Menus_6.htm_IX_HINT_INTERACTION_DISCARD_WHEN_CLOSED">
 </A>
 indicates that the GenInteraction object (which must be a dialog box) can be discarded from memory when it is brought off-screen. This is an optimazation designed to free up memory. If the GenInteraction contains this hint, it must also be marked GIA_NOT_USER_INITIATABLE (to prevent it from being referenced), and contain a one-way upward generic link only.

Each of the following visibilities is an enumeration of type <CODE>
GenInteractionVisibility</CODE>
; therefore, you may select one and only one of the following types for your Interaction. By default, a GenInteraction is GIV_SUB_GROUP.</P>
<DL>
<DT>
GIV_SUB_GROUP</DT><DD>
This specifies that the Interaction serves as a visual grouping of objects within a larger window. This visibility creates an Interaction within the parent window and is therefore not independently displayable. This visibility is the default case.</DD>
<DT>
GIV_POPUP</DT><DD>This specifies that this Interaction is temporary and only appears on-screen for the duration of a single selection. In most specific UIs, the popup will stay up until either an object in the Interaction is activated or until the user clicks somewhere else. Some specific UIs allow a menu to be pinned, however. The most common manifestation of a popup is a menu. Popups typically appear within appropriate &quot;menu bars&quot; of an application but may be independently displayable under different specific UIs. </DD>
<DT>
GIV_DIALOG</DT><DD>This specifies that this Interaction should appear as a dialog box. A dialog box is a temporary window used to display controls or request information from the user. A dialog box can typically contain any number or variety of other generic objects. A dialog box may be either modal or non-modal.</DD>
<DT>
GIV_CONTROL_GROUP</DT><DD>
This specifies that this Interaction contains controls and therefore should not appear as a popup Interaction. This prevents the Interaction from disappearing before the user can select an entry in the control group. A control group Interaction may appear as either a sub-group or dialog, depending on the specific UI and its position within the application's generic object tree.</DD>
<DT>
GIV_POPOUT</DT><DD>
This specifies that the GenInteraction may act as either a sub-group or as a dialog box, depending on its state. Usually, popouts act as normal sub-group Interactions until the user or the application &quot;pops&quot; them out into a dialog box. Popouts are normally &quot;popped out&quot; into their dialog box state by double-clicking within the confines of the GenInteraction. This popout state is reflected with either the presence or absence of the ATTR_GEN_INTERACTION_POPPED_OUT vardata entry.</DD>
<DT>
GIV_NO_PREFERENCE</DT><DD>
This specifies that there is no visual preference for this Interaction. The specific UI will create the Interaction based on hints, the types of children it contains, and its location in the generic tree.</DD>

You may also retrieve or set the visibility of any Interaction at run-time. To retrieve the <CODE>

Standard Interactions (Menus)</H3>
<PRE>ATTR_GEN_INTERACTION_GROUP_TYPE, GenInteractionGroupType</PRE>
<P>
Often you will set up standard menus such as the File menu, the Window menu, the Edit menu, and the View menu. You can set these menus up very simply, with the attribute <CODE>
ATTR_GEN_INTERACTION_GROUP_TYPE</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
This attribute specifies the type of menu the GenInteraction is via a value of type <CODE>
GenInteractionGroupType</CODE>
. This can be any of the following:</P>
<DL>
<DT>
GIGT_FILE_MENU</DT><DD>
Creates a standard File menu. Typically has a document control and print control as its children.</DD>
<DT>
GIGT_EDIT_MENU</DT><DD>
Creates a standard Edit menu with Cut, Copy, Paste, and Undo as appropriate. Typically has a GenEditControl as its child.</DD>
<DT>
GIGT_VIEW_MENU</DT><DD>
Creates a standard View menu; typically has a GenView controller as its child.</DD>
<DT>
GIGT_OPTIONS_MENU</DT><DD>
Creates a standard Options menu; typically, this menu has application-specific option entries as well as a GenToolControl as its children.</DD>
<DT>
GIGT_WINDOW_MENU</DT><DD>
Creates a standard Window menu; typically has a display controller as its child.</DD>
<DT>
GIGT_HELP_MENU</DT><DD>
Creates a standard Help menu; typically has the help objects as its children.</DD>
<DT>
GIGT_PRINT_GROUP</DT><DD>
Indicates that the GenInteraction is the print group. Typically contains a print controller and other print commands.</DD>
</DL>
<P>
Each of the above types will set up the proper GenInteraction attributes and other generic objects to complete the interactions. Thus, by setting up a GenInteraction like this:</P>
<PRE>@object GenInteractionClass MyEditMenu = {
	GI_comp = MyEditControl;
	GII_visibility = GIV_POPUP;
	ATTR_GEN_INTERACTION_GROUP_TYPE =
			(GIGT_EDIT_MENU);
}</PRE>
<P>
you can have a complete Edit menu in your program. (Of course, you must also supply the GenEditControl object that would be MyEditControl in the example.)</P>

The <CODE>
GII_type </CODE>
instance field describes the contents of the Interaction. This attribute depends on the makeup of the children within the Interaction. (Note that it would be unusual for an Interaction to appear without children.) In most cases, this will directly affect the functionality of the particular Interaction. Every GenInteraction object should contain children that perform some function within the UI. That function is determined in part by this instance field.</P>

Each of the following types is an enumeration of <CODE>
GenInteractionType</CODE>
; therefore, you may select one and only one of the following types for your Interaction. By default, a GenInteraction is GIT_ORGANIZATIONAL. </P>
<DL>
<DT>
GIT_ORGANIZATIONAL</DT><DD>
This specifies that the Interaction is merely organizational. This allows the Interaction to provide geometry management (and not much else) to its children. Any objects within an organizational Interaction should be able to perform their actions independently. Organizational Interactions may appear in any visual form: sub-groups, menus, or dialog boxes.</DD>
<DT>
GIT_PROPERTIES</DT><DD>
<A NAME="Menus_9.htm_IX_Properties gadgets:GIT_PROPERTIES">
 </A>
This specifies that the Interaction contains properties (attributes) that the user can change. Typically, a properties Interaction will operate in one of two modes: immediate or delayed. If the <CODE>
GII_visibility</CODE>
 attribute causes this Interaction to appear as a dialog box, the specific UI may create &quot;Apply&quot; and &quot;Reset&quot; triggers. In delayed mode, an apply trigger allows the Interaction to process changes made within the properties Interaction as a group rather than individually; the reset trigger allows the Interaction to reset the properties to their former state. If a popup is GIT_PROPERTIES, it will operate in immediate mode even if hints attempt to override this.</DD>
<DT>
GIT_PROGRESS</DT><DD>
This specifies that the Interaction displays a progress report for some operation. For example, a dialog box may appear showing a disk copy operation with the time remaining to its completion. If the <CODE>
GII_visibility</CODE>
 attribute causes this Interaction to appear as a dialog box, the specific UI may create a &quot;Stop&quot; trigger that halts the operation in progress and the progress reporting. Your application is responsible for stopping the Interaction from communicating its progress report and may dismiss the Interaction if the specific UI desires.</DD>
<DT>
GIT_COMMAND</DT><DD>
This specifies that the Interaction contains commands that the application provides. If the <CODE>
GII_visibility</CODE>
 attribute causes this Interaction to appear as a dialog box, the specific UI may create a &quot;Close&quot; trigger to dismiss the dialog. You will have to supply your own specific command triggers within a GIT_COMMAND dialog box. </DD>
<DT>
GIT_NOTIFICATION</DT><DD>
This specifies that the Interaction sends notification of some event. If the <CODE>
GII_visibility</CODE>
 attribute causes this Interaction to appear as a dialog box, the specific UI may create an &quot;OK&quot; trigger that the user can press to acknowledge the notification.</DD>
<DT>
GIT_AFFIRMATION</DT><DD>
This specifies that the Interaction asks for confirmation of an operation. If the <CODE>
GII_visibility </CODE>
attribute causes this Interaction to appear as a dialog box, the specific UI may create &quot;Yes&quot; and &quot;No&quot; triggers. Depending upon the Specific UI, these triggers may dismiss the dialog box.</DD>
<DT>
GIT_MULTIPLE_RESPONSE</DT><DD>
This specifies that this Interaction may include multiple items that the user can respond to. (Your application should add custom response triggers using the GenTrigger's vardata <CODE>
ATTR_GEN_TRIGGER_INTERACTION_COMMAND</CODE>
.) If you wish these triggers to appear in a dialog box reply bar, use <CODE>

GIA_NOT_USER_INITIATABLE</DT><DD>
This attribute specifies that the user cannot bring up the dialog directly. Unless this attribute is set, most specific UIs will place a default activation trigger within a proper place in the UI to initiate the dialog box. This attribute prevents this trigger from appearing. To bring up a dialog box set GIA_NOT_USER_INITIATABLE, your application must send the dialog a <CODE>
MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_INITIATE.</CODE>
 Usually, these Interactions should be direct children of either a GenPrimary or GenApplication. </DD>
<DT>
GIA_INITIATED_VIA_USER_DO_DIALOG</DT><DD>
This attribute specifies that the application brings up this Interaction through <CODE>
UserDoDialog</CODE>
<CODE>
()</CODE>
. You should use this routine in special cases where you need the user to respond to a dialog box before continuing with your application thread. (This routine blocks the calling thread until the user responds to the dialog box.) Any dialog boxes marked with this attribute should <EM>
not</EM>
 be initiated with MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_INITIATE. The UI won't include a default activation trigger for dialog boxes with this attribute.</DD>

<P>
If your application contains several dialog boxes sitting directly under a GenPrimary (typically with their GIA_NOT_USER_INITIATABLE attribute), the application may take longer to start up. This happens because the system will have to process each of the dialogs individually and determine at that point that a trigger should not be created for them.</P>
<P>
You may instead wish to create an organizational Interaction to manage these non-user initiatable Interactions. To do this, create a single GIT_ORGANIZATIONAL GIA_NOT_USER_INITIATABLE dialog box under the GenPrimary. All &quot;real&quot; dialogs should then be placed as children of this &quot;holding&quot; Interaction. When the application starts up, it only needs to process this one Interaction. </P>

GenInteraction Usage</H2>
<P>
You will probably need to create GenInteractions at various points within your application. The GenInteraction object is one of the most flexible generic objects within GEOS. Not only can an Interaction operate as a menu, dialog, or sub-group, but there also exist several pre-defined dialog boxes with default triggers for your use. These dialogs will make writing your application easier and faster. The simplest way to see the wide variety of options available to you is to examine the different types of Interactions available with different instance data values.</P>

Visibilities</H3>
<P>
When first creating an Interaction, you must decide in what form to visually present your communication between the application and the user. This concern may be somewhat cosmetic in form but may also affect the functionality of the Interaction itself. For instance, more than one <CODE>
GenInteractionType</CODE>
 will support different actions with different visibility types.</P>

You can use hints provided in <CODE>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenInteractions as Menus (GIV_POPUP)</H4>
<P>
<A NAME="Menus_c.htm_IX_GIV_POPUP">
 </A>
Most specific UIs implement GIV_POPUP as a menu. Menus are interactions with options that only appear when the menu is activated by the user. Popups make it possible for a user to browse and choose among a variety of commands without cluttering up the UI with dozens of objects. A popup may appear at almost any location within the UI. If a popup is placed as a direct child of a GenPrimary, it may appear in an appropriate menu bar location across the top of the window. </P>
<P>
A popup is most often one of GIT_ORGANIZATIONAL, GIT_PROPERTIES, or GIT_COMMAND. (See <A HREF="#Menus_9.htm_39653"> GenInteraction Types</A>
.) What type of popup you select depends on the type of children the Interaction contains. For example, an application may implement a font menu as a GIT_PROPERTIES popup. A GIT_COMMAND popup might issue commands relating to the appearance of text within a text editor. Depending on the <CODE>
GenInteractionType</CODE>
, a popup may appear in forms other than a menu. (The specific UI has final say over the appearance of a popup.)</P>
<P>
A GIV_POPUP Interaction must contain a group of children. If the Interaction appears as a menu, these children will become menu items. Most often, these children will be GenTriggers or GenItems within GenItemGroups.</P>

    GTI_actionMsg = MSG_HELLO_CHANGE_TO_GOLD;						/* Send this message. */
}</PRE>
<P>
If a child of the GIV_POPUP Interaction is another Interaction, the specific UI might change the visual implementation of that child. What change takes place depends on the specific UI. In OSF/Motif, for example, placing a sub-group Interaction within a popup Interaction causes the UI to draw lines separating the sub-group from the other children in the popup. (You may prevent this line by adding <CODE>
HINT_SAME_CATEGORY_AS_PARENT</CODE>
.)

</P>
<P>
Placing a popup interaction within another popup is a special case and will create nested menus under most specific UIs. To do this, merely create a GIV_POPUP Interaction as a child of another GIV_POPUP Interaction. The specific UI will automatically create the second menu as a sub-menu of the first. The item in the menu bringing up the sub-menu may be labeled with an arrow under certain specific UIs. Menus may be nested to an arbitrary number of levels. 

</P>

<P>
List Objects (GenItemGroups and GenBooleanGroups) within a GIV_POPUP Interaction may be used to show object properties in a menu. The menu should be GIT_PROPERTIES in this case. Depending on the Specific UI, a properties menu may be implemented in a different fashion from other menus. (In OSF/Motif, there is no visual difference between a properties menu and other menus.) Other types have no effect on the behavior or appearance of GIV_POPUPs.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenInteractions as Dialog Boxes (GIV_DIALOG)</H4>
<P>
<A NAME="Menus_c.htm_IX_GIV_DIALOG">
 </A>
The GIV_DIALOG visibility will instruct the specific UI to build the Interaction as a dialog box. A dialog box is an independently-displayable interface element used to display information or other UI objects. Therefore, it is similar to a window although there are some differences. (Most dialog boxes, for example, are not resizable whereas most windows are.)</P>
<P>
Dialog boxes also enhance the functionality of other<CODE>
 GenInteractionType</CODE>
s. Many GII<CODE>
_types</CODE>
 are only significant as dialog boxes. For example, a GIT_NOTIFICATION Interaction will only appear with an &quot;OK&quot; trigger if it is also a dialog box. A GIT_PROPERTIES Interaction may contain properties within any visibility, but only if built as a dialog can it implement delayed mode. (If a GIT_PROPERTIES Interaction is built as a menu or sub-group, it will always operate in immediate mode.) Delayed mode allows the user to change the properties of an object and later apply those changes all at once. Within a dialog box, an &quot;Apply&quot; trigger will make these changes.

</P>
<P>
Most specific UIs will build a dialog box with an activation trigger present in the UI that brings up the dialog box. These dialog boxes are known as user initiatable. There are ways to override this behavior if you need a non-user initiatable dialog box or a dialog box that blocks the calling thread until answered (forcing the user to respond to the dialog box immediately). See <A HREF="#Menus_11.htm_82521"> Modality for Dialogs</A>
.</P>
<P>
By default, dialog boxes are not resizable. <CODE>
HINT_INTERACTION_MAKE_RESIZABLE</CODE>
 may be used on a non-modal dialog box to make that dialog resizable. In OSF/Motif, the Specific UI will supply such a dialog with a means to alter its shape. <CODE>
HINT_INTERACTION_MAKE_RESIZABLE</CODE>
 is only meaningful for GIV_DIALOG Interactions. </P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenInteractions as Popouts (GIV_POPOUTS)</H4>
<PRE>MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_POP_IN, MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_POP_OUT, MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_TOGGLE_POPOUT</PRE>
<P>
Popouts are special GenInteractions that may act as either sub-group Interactions or as dialog boxes, depending on their state. Usually, popouts act as normal sub-group Interactions until the user or the application &quot;pops&quot; them out into a dialog box. Popouts are normally &quot;popped out&quot; into their dialog box state by double-clicking within the confines of the GenInteraction. This popout state is reflected with either the presence or absence of the ATTR_GEN_INTERACTION_POPPED_OUT vardata entry.</P>
<P>
You can pop out a GIV_POPOUT GenInteraction in its sub-group state by sending it MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_POP_OUT. Similarly, you can pop a GIV_POPOUT back into its sub-group state from the dialog box state by sending it MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_POP_IN. MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_TOGGLE_POPOUT toggles a popout from whatever state it currently is into its other state.

</P>
<P>
By default, popouts in their dialog box state contain a special trigger to pop them back into their sub-group state. They may also be popped back in by double-clicking within the popped-out GenInteraction. Popouts also normally provide a close trigger; this trigger dismisses the dialog box but does not return the popout to its sub-group state. You should provide a trigger somewhere within your UI that sends MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_POP_IN or MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_POP_OUT to the popout, so that the user can bring any popout they dismiss back on-screen. Alternatively, you can add ATTR_GEN_INTERACTION_POPOUT_NOT_CLOSABLE on the Popout to prevent the creation of a &quot;Close&quot; trigger.</P>

<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">Menus and Dialog Boxes</A>: 3.2 <A HREF="#Menus_b.htm">GenInteraction Usage</A>: 
Types</H3>
<P>
Possibly more important than how an Interaction is visually displayed is what role that Interaction should play within your UI. That role depends in part on what children the Interaction contains. What the Interaction does with those children is determined by the <CODE>
GenInteractionType</CODE>
 of that object. Interactions of different visibility may function in essentially the same manner, but Interactions of different types may differ greatly in their functionality.</P>
<P>
For example, if an Interaction contains a GenItemGroup with three GenItem children, it will not affect the basic functionality if that Interaction is built as a dialog, popup, or sub-group. Each item will still perform its default function (such as sending a message). The GII<EM>
_type</EM>
 of Interaction might affect that functionality, however, by forcing the Items to send out their messages as a group or individually (for example in a GIT_PROPERTIES Interaction).</P>
<P>
You should pick the <CODE>
GenInteractionType</CODE>
 based on what actions you wish to perform on the children you select for the Interaction. By default, an Interaction is of type GIT_ORGANIZATIONAL. In some cases, the functionality you need will reside entirely with the children; in those cases, a GIT_ORGANIZATIONAL will most likely suffice.</P>
<P>
Certain <CODE>
GenInteractionType</CODE>
 Interactions, if built as GIV_DIALOG, may create a reply bar with <EM>
standard</EM>
 <EM>
response</EM>
 <EM>
triggers</EM>
. A reply bar is a special area of a dialog Interaction to place commands for user responses. Standard response triggers perform additional actions for dialog Interactions, apart from any functionality your application provides. You do not need to add these triggers yourself; they are added by the Specific UI.</P>
<P>
Standard response triggers perform one of several pre-defined <CODE>
InteractionCommand </CODE>
commands. Depending on the particular type of Interaction, each<CODE>
 </CODE>
command may perform different actions. An <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
 is a special data type that the Specific UI recognizes. The Specific UI decides what action to take upon receiving this command; depending on the value of the <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
, the Specific UI may perform several different actions. </P>
<P>
For example, the GIT_NOTIFICATION type, if built as a dialog box, may create an &quot;OK&quot; trigger automatically. The trigger will become one of the dialog box's children. This trigger sends out the <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
 IC_OK when activated. The Specific UI will also decide how to implement that IC_OK message. (In OSF/Motif, for example, IC_OK will dismiss the dialog box as one of its actions.) </P>
<P>
You can create your own response triggers within an Interaction. You can also replace any standard response trigger by supplying one of your own. For complete information on how <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
s and response triggers work, see <A HREF="#Menus_14.htm_56756"> Interaction Commands</A>
.</P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Organizational Interactions</H4>
<P>
An organizational interaction is the simplest type of interaction. It is also the default <CODE>
GenInteractionType</CODE>
. An organizational Interaction only functions to contain objects--without indicating any meaning to the makeup of those objects. Because of this, a GIT_ORGANIZATIONAL Interaction should not interpret any <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
 types. See <A HREF="#Menus_14.htm_56756"> Interaction Commands</A>
.</P>
<P>
GIT_ORGANIZATIONAL<A NAME="Menus_d.htm_IX_GIT_ORGANIZATIONAL">
 </A>
 Interactions are only used, therefore, to group their children; there is never any implied meaning to the children they contain. The Interaction may have a certain visual form defined in its <CODE>
GenInteractionVisibility</CODE>
 field, but presumably the Interaction should perform its activity under any visible arrangement.</P>
<P>
You will most often need an organizational Interaction to arrange objects within another window, whether that &quot;window&quot; is a GenPrimary or a GIV_DIALOG GenInteraction. For example, you may need organizational Interactions solely to arrange a group of generic children in a horizontal or vertical row. There are several hints in <CODE>
GenClass</CODE>
 that may affect the visual implementation of an organizational Interaction. See <A HREF="../../UI/Geometry/index.htm">the Managing UI Geometry chapter</A>for full details. </P>
<P>
Organizational Interactions may appear as sub-groups, menus, or dialog boxes; each of its items should already contain all the functionality needed. For example, an edit menu (GIV_POPUP Interaction) with three triggers (Cut, Copy, and Paste) could be organizational if each of those triggers is capable of performing its action purely through the sending of a message (a function of <CODE>
GenTriggerClass</CODE>
). </P>
<P>
No standard response triggers are provided with a GIT_ORGANIZATIONAL Interaction, even if it is built as a dialog box, though you may supply your own. See <A HREF="#Menus_17.htm_90972"> Standard Response Triggers</A>

 Interactions allow the Interaction to display and set attributes of a specific selected object (the &quot;current selection&quot;). In many cases, this current selection will be the target of the application. (See <A HREF="../../SysObjects/Input/index.htm">the Input chapter</A>.) Users can change the UI gadgets in the properties group to change the attributes of the selected object. When the user selects a different object, the UI gadgetry changes to reflect the attributes of the new selection.</P><P>
For example, a properties dialog may alter text properties within a text editor. If some text is selected, changing properties in the text dialog will change the appearance of the text. </P>
<P>
Properties Interactions may appear as sub-groups, popups, or dialog boxes. If a properties Interaction takes the form of a dialog box, the Specific UI may create response triggers with the <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
 types IC_APPLY, IC_RESET and IC_DISMISS. These triggers will either apply changes made in the properties group, reset those changes to their initial state, or close the dialog, respectively. In OSF/Motif these triggers are labeled &quot;Apply&quot; or &quot;OK,&quot; &quot;Reset,&quot; and &quot;Close&quot; or &quot;Cancel.&quot;

<P>
There are two ways that an application can deal with UI gadgetry in a property dialog. Either the application can work completely off the state change notification messages sent by the UI gadgetry when the properties are changed, or the application may need to do some extra work after the properties are changed. This extra work can include checking for valid settings in the UI gadgetry, querying the UI gadgetry for their states, or dealing with the UI gadgetry as a group rather than individually (i.e. fetching each of their states and using them all at once to make a single change instead of making separate changes for each state).</P>

<H5 CLASS="HeadingD">
<A NAME="Menus_d.htm_37121">
 </A>
Delayed and Immediate Mode</H5>
<P>
Properties dialogs work in one of two modes: immediate and delayed. In immediate mode, the UI gadgetry within a properties box reflects the actual state of those objects. Changing selections within the properties Interaction changes the state of those objects immediately. For example, if a &quot;Fonts&quot; dialog box containing a list of font selections is in immediate mode, selecting each separate font will cause the selected text to immediately display itself in the selected font.</P>
<P>
In delayed mode, the UI gadgetry within the properties box reflects a separate &quot;user&quot; state rather than the actual state. The user is free to change settings within the properties Interaction without causing such changes to be made on the object immediately. The UI does this by storing two states for the UI gadgetry: the actual state (which reflects the current state of the objects) and a user state (which reflects the state specified in the dialog box). The user can apply changes made within a delayed mode properties Interaction with use of an &quot;Apply&quot; mechanism. Usually, the Specific UI will provide an &quot;Apply&quot; trigger for such a case.</P>
<P>
If either the Specific UI or hints determine that the properties dialog box should be run in delayed mode, an apply trigger will be supplied. In OSF/Motif, an &quot;Apply&quot; trigger will be placed in a reply bar along with a &quot;Close&quot; trigger that dismisses the property box. </P>


<H5 CLASS="HeadingD">
Properties Hints</H5>
<P>
The GIT_PROPERTIES type and GIV_DIALOG visibility indicate to the Specific UI to build a property dialog box. The Specific UI will also determine whether this box should run in immediate or delayed mode. Because the application works completely through its UI gadgets within the dialog, it will support either mode. However, there are good reasons for wanting the properties to work in one mode or another. You can supply additional hints for this purpose.</P>
<P>
These hints only affect the behavior of properties dialog boxes (GIV_DIALOG). Therefore, if an Interaction is a GIV_POPUP or GIV_SUB_GROUP, these hints will have no effect. If the Interaction is a GIV_CONTROL_GROUP or GIV_NO_PREFERENCE, these hints may force the object to appear as a dialog box.</P>
<P>

HINT_INTERACTION_COMPLEX_PROPERTIES</CODE>
<A NAME="Menus_d.htm_IX_HINT_INTERACTION_COMPLEX_PROPERTIES">

<CODE>
HINT_INTERACTION_SIMPLE_PROPERTIES</CODE>
<A NAME="Menus_d.htm_IX_HINT_INTERACTION_SIMPLE_PROPERTIES">

HINT_INTERACTION_RELATED_PROPERTIES</CODE>
<A NAME="Menus_d.htm_IX_HINT_INTERACTION_RELATED_PROPERTIES">

Therefore, the specific UI should run the objects as a group in delayed mode and provide an &quot;Apply&quot; trigger.

HINT_INTERACTION_UNRELATED_PROPERTIES</CODE>
<A NAME="Menus_d.htm_IX_HINT_INTERACTION_UNRELATED_PROPERTIES">

Modifying Triggers for Custom Properties</H5>
<PRE>HINT_INTERACTION_REQUIRES_VALIDATION</PRE>
<P>
If an application needs to do additional work on a properties dialog box, such as validation of the attributes, you should define a &quot;custom&quot; properties dialog box. You can do this by replacing the default &quot;Apply&quot; and &quot;Reset&quot; triggers with ones of your own design.</P>
<P>
<CODE>
HINT_INTERACTION_REQUIRES_VALIDATION</CODE>
<A NAME="Menus_d.htm_IX_HINT_INTERACTION_REQUIRES_VALIDATION">
 </A>
 indicates that this properties dialog should prompt the user for verification before implementing changes to the properties group. The Interaction will thus be implemented in delayed mode while also allowing a custom &quot;Apply&quot; trigger. The trigger action should be handled in the normal fashion to add any additional functionality to validate before proceeding with the apply.</P>
<P>
You can modify the standard IC_APPLY trigger by adding your own apply trigger with ATTR_GEN_TRIGGER_INTERACTION_COMMAND set to IC_APPLY. This trigger will replace the default IC_APPLY trigger that the Specific UI would have supplied otherwise. <CODE>
HINT_SEEK_REPLY_BAR</CODE>
 places the trigger in the property dialog's reply bar. In the GenInteraction itself, you might want to include <CODE>
HINT_INTERACTION_REQUIRES_VALIDATION</CODE>
 or another more appropriate hint to ensure that the properties dialog will be working in delayed mode.</P>
<P>
An application-supplied trigger allows the application to define whatever action output and method it desires. When the user activates this trigger, the action message will be sent out to the action output (as usual for GenTriggers); the default IC_APPLY functionality will not be performed. In the handler for this custom message, the application can do whatever is necessary with the properties dialog (such as validation of the attributes). </P>
<P>
When finished, the application can either manually fetch the state of the attributes or send <CODE>
MSG_GEN_GUP_INTERACTION_COMMAND</CODE>
 with IC_APPLY to the GenInteraction. (This is the default behavior of an IC_APPLY <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
.) You may choose not to send out this message if you wish to replace instead of supplement the default behavior.</P>
<P>
Finally, you can send <CODE>
MSG_GEN_GUP_INTERACTION_COMMAND</CODE>
 with IC_INTERACTION_COMPLETE to notify the GenInteraction that the user has finished a single usage of the Interaction. (You may also mark such a trigger with GA_SIGNAL_INTERACTION_COMPLETE.) Upon this notification, the specific UI will decide if the GenInteraction should be dismissed. Instead, you may send IC_DISMISS to unconditionally dismiss the Interaction.</P>

The moniker for an application-supplied apply trigger may be set by the application or (preferably) left blank so that the Specific UI can provide an appropriate moniker. The Specific UI uses the IC_APPLY data in the <CODE>

If the application wants to alter a moniker but does not need to do any other work, the trigger's output fields should be left blank. Because the trigger has <CODE>

Just as you may use ATTR_GEN_TRIGGER_INTERACTION_COMMAND with IC_APPLY to provide a custom apply trigger, you may use ATTR_GEN_TRIGGER_INTERACTION_COMMAND with IC_RESET to provide a custom reset trigger. This is useful if the application needs to do some additional work when the user resets the attributes or if the application wishes to override the default reset moniker (&quot;Reset&quot; in OSF/Motif). You may still perform the default reset behavior (sending <CODE>
MSG_GEN_RESET</CODE>

 with IC_RESET to the properties Interaction.</P>

Command Interactions</H4>
<P>
GIT_COMMAND<A NAME="Menus_d.htm_IX_GIT_COMMAND">
 </A>
 Interactions allow the user to set up parameters for and issue commands. For example, a &quot;rename file&quot; command in a file manager application needs to request the new name for the file from the user. This can be done with a command dialog that shows the file's current name and has a text entry field for the file's new name. A reply bar with a &quot;Rename&quot; action trigger could be provided to initiate the rename action when the user has finished entering the new name. </P>

Command Interactions can appear as menus, dialogs, or sub-groups within a larger window. If the Interaction is displayed as a dialog, the specific UI may provide a response trigger with the IC_DISMISS <CODE>

Command dialogs provide applications with a place to group related commands. They also provide a convenient place to locate UI gadgetry needed to set up parameters used by commands.

The Rename trigger in the above example is marked <CODE>
HINT_SEEK_REPLY_BAR</CODE>

<P>
You may wish to modify this closing behavior, however. For example, if the user chooses an invalid destination name, you might not want to close that dialog; instead, the dialog should remain up and the user should be alerted that he has chosen an incorrect destination. In this case, you should remove the GA_SIGNAL_INTERACTION_COMPLETE attribute from the trigger. You should then handle the closing behavior, after validating the destination, in the <CODE>

In OSF/Motif this means that a system menu for a non-modal progress dialog will have its &quot;Close&quot; trigger disabled.</P>
<P>
For example, you can use a progress dialog to report the progress of a disk format. Gadgets within the progress dialog might reflect the current state of the disk format (for example, a bar indicating the time-percentage of the operation completed). A &quot;Stop&quot; trigger in the reply bar allows the user to abort the disk format. Your application should intercept the <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
 IC_STOP in this case so that you can perform any actions required in the halting operation.

<P>
A progress dialog may be either modal or non-modal, depending on the application and the operation in progress. The <CODE>
GenInteractionType</CODE>
 GIT_PROGRESS is designed for cases where the application supports stopping an in-progress operation.</P>
<P>
While the Specific UI will supply an IC_STOP trigger in the reply bar for halting the on-going operation, the trigger by itself does nothing. You must either replace this IC_STOP trigger with one that performs the required halting operation, or you must provide a subclass of GenInteraction to intercept <CODE>

Notification Interactions</H4>
<P>
GIT_NOTIFICATION<A NAME="Menus_d.htm_IX_GIT_NOTIFICATION">

 Interactions allow your application to send notices to the user. You should use a notification Interaction when you wish to notify the user of an event without needing to prompt the user for further information.</P>
<P>
GIT_NOTIFICATION interactions normally appear as dialogs. If so, the Specific UI will create a response trigger with the <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
 IC_OK. This command will close the dialog box in most Specific UIs. In OSF/Motif, this trigger is labeled &quot;OK.&quot; The Specific UI will not supply a way to close the dialog without responding with this trigger. In OSF/Motif, this means that the system menu in a non-modal notification dialog will have its &quot;Close&quot; trigger disabled.</P>
<P>
A notification Interaction may in theory be of any visibility, but it usually takes the form of a modal dialog box. Therefore, the user should only need to acknowledge the dialog box (usually by activating the &quot;OK&quot; trigger).
<IMG SRC="Menus_d_notifDump.gif">

<P>
You will usually require a notification dialog when you need to let the user know that something has occurred that may or may not require his immediate attention. For example, a notification dialog would be appropriate to notify the user that new e-mail has arrived; a notification dialog would also be appropriate to notify the user that an error has occurred. </P>
<P>
Notifications that require immediate attention should be marked GIA_MODAL or <CODE>
HINT_INTERACTION_MODAL</CODE>

For example, your application may need to prompt the user with a yes or no question (such as &quot;Do you want to continue?&quot;). Depending on the value returned in the <CODE>

Toolboxes are useful to display small icons for commonly used operations. Toolboxes are normally provided by controllers.

Initiating Interactions</H3>
<PRE>MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_INITIATE, MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_INITIATE_NO_DISTURB, MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_DISABLE_DISCARDING</PRE>
<P>
For the most part, the Specific UI decides in what way Interactions should be initiated. For example, a popup built as a menu will create a menu title which, when activated, brings down the menu. A dialog box will create an activation trigger within the UI that, when activated, brings the dialog box on-screen. (Notice that it is meaningless to &quot;initiate&quot; a sub-group Interaction as these objects are not independently-displayable.)</P>
<P>
You may wish to modify this behavior, either to prevent the user from directly initiating an Interaction, or to add additional ways to bring these Interactions on-screen. </P>
<P>
Although in most cases the user is responsible for activating menus (by activating the menu title), an application may manually open a menu with <CODE>
MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_INITIATE</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
A GIV_DIALOG Interaction may be initiated in several ways:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
In the default case, the specific UI will create an activation trigger whose sole function is to bring up the dialog box. The trigger will appear as a child of the dialog's parent, in the spot within the UI that the dialog would normally reside were it not independently displayable.</LI>
<LI>
A dialog box may be set GIA_NOT_USER_INITIATABLE to prevent the building of the default trigger. Any Interaction set non-user initiatable should be sent a <CODE>
MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_INITIATE</CODE>
 or a <CODE>
MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_INITIATE_NO_DISTURB</CODE>
 to bring the dialog on-screen. You may also put Interactions on the GAGCNLT_WINDOWS GCN list to automatically bring them on-screen when an application is launched. Any Interaction must be fully usable and enabled to be brought up in such a manner. Note: If a dialog box is also marked GIA_INITIATED_VIA_USER_DO_DIALOG, it should be initiated with <CODE>
UserDoDialog()</CODE>
, <EM>
not</EM>
 MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_INITIATE. These methods are exclusive.</LI>
<LI>
A dialog box may be brought up with <CODE>
UserDoDialog()</CODE>
 if it is set GIA_INITIATED_VIA_USER_DO_DIALOG. This routine is useful when you wish to block the calling thread until the user responds to the dialog box. A dialog box initiated via <CODE>
UserDoDialog()</CODE>
 should also be marked GIA_NOT_USER_INITIATABLE. Note that this dialog box may only be brought up with <CODE>
UserDoDialog()</CODE>
; it cannot be brought up with MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_INITIATE.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Within most specific UIs a trigger will appear whose sole function is to initiate the dialog. Activating the trigger will bring the dialog box on-screen. You can prevent the display of this default trigger by setting the Interaction GIA_NOT_USER_INITIATABLE in its <CODE>
GII_attrs</CODE>
 instance field. (See <A HREF="#Menus_a.htm_79428"> GenInteraction Attributes</A>
). 

</P>
<P>
Your GenInteraction subclass may intercept <CODE>
MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_INITIATE</CODE>
 to determine when a dialog is being brought on-screen and then perform any needed actions at that time. This is useful if you need to update the UI objects within the dialog before building its visual implementation. You should always call the superclass <EM>
after</EM>
 setting any of this initial data to avoid unnecessary visual updates of the dialog box. <CODE>
MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_INITIATE_NO_DISTURB</CODE>
 may also be subclassed, but there is little need to intercept it.</P>
<P>
GenInteraction dialog boxes may be marked <CODE>
HINT_INTERACTION_DISCARD_WHEN_CLOSED</CODE>
.This hint informs the system to discard the dialog box's object block when it is no longer being used, but there is a timing problem if the dialog box needs to be initialized before it is brough on-screen.

<P>
In that case, send the dialog box <CODE>

Modality for Dialogs</H3>
<PRE>MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_TEST_INPUT_RESTRICTABILITY</PRE>
<P>
By default, GIV_DIALOG GenInteractions appear as non-modal windows. You may specify a dialog Interaction to appear as modal by setting either the GIA_MODAL attribute in the <CODE>
GII_attrs</CODE>
 instance data field or by adding <CODE>
HINT_INTERACTION_MODAL</CODE>
 in the object's vardata. When a modal dialog is displayed, input to all other parts of the application will be ignored until the dialog is dismissed. In OSF/Motif, modal dialogs will appear with thick borders.
<IMG SRC="Menus_11_modal.gif">

</P>
<P>
You should use GIA_MODAL dialogs when the application depends on an Interaction being modal to operate correctly. For example, if a dialog shows information about the current selection but the application cannot update that information if the user were to change the current selection, you should use a GIA_MODAL dialog.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Menus_11.htm_IX_HINT_INTERACTION_MODAL">
 </A>
You should use <CODE>
HINT_INTERACTION_MODAL</CODE>
 dialogs for cases where the modality of a dialog simplifies the interface between the application and the user but is not needed for the application's correct operation. The Interaction's modality in this case will make the UI clearer and simpler for the user to understand. For example, a dialog for setting obscure options that is brought up from a command dialog might be marked HINT_INTERACTION_MODAL so that the user is forced to set the options before returning to the command dialog. This will prevent the user from using this dialog box in a context where the options are not self-evident. As with all hints, the Specific UI may decide to ignore the hint and implement a HINT_INTERACTION_MODAL dialog with a non-modal dialog. </P>
<P>
You may also initiate a modal dialog with <CODE>
UserDoDialog()</CODE>
. Such a dialog must have both the GIA_INITIATED_VIA_USER_DO_DIALOG and GIA_MODAL attributes set. Using this routine not only blocks input to other parts of the application but blocks the calling thread's execution until the dialog is dismissed. <CODE>
UserDoDialog()</CODE>
 is useful for displaying notifications where the user's response is required before the application's thread may continue. For more information, see <A HREF="#Menus_13.htm_75893"> Thread Blocking Routines</A>

Thread Blocking Routines</H3>
<P>
Occasionally, you may need a response from the user before continuing with a thread of execution. In these cases, you should use a dialog box to prompt the user for the needed response. However, you also need a means to block the thread of execution until the user responds to this dialog box. The routines <CODE>
UserDoDialog()</CODE>
, <CODE>
UserStandardDialog()</CODE>
, and <CODE>
UserStandardDialogOptr()</CODE>

You may bring dialog boxes on-screen with several routines. The most common and easiest to use of these routines is <CODE>
UserDoDialog()</CODE>
. <CODE>
UserDoDialog()</CODE>
 only operates on GIV_DIALOG Interactions set both GIA_MODAL and GIA_INITIATED_WITH_USER_DO_DIALOG. </P>
<P>
This routine, when passed the optr of a dialog box, will bring the dialog Interaction on-screen. In addition to bringing up a dialog, however, <CODE>
UserDoDialog()</CODE>
 will also block the calling thread until a response trigger in the dialog is activated by the user. When this happens, <CODE>
UserDoDialog()</CODE>
 returns a value representing the response trigger selected. This return value is usually an <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
The dialog may contain any UI gadgetry but must have response triggers with valid <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
s to terminate the dialog box. These triggers should have a null output and message and have <CODE>
ATTR_GEN_TRIGGER_INTERACTION_COMMAND</CODE>
 vardata set to the proper <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
s. (See <A HREF="../../UI/Triggers/index.htm">the GenTrigger chapter</A>.) This <CODE>InteractionCommand</CODE>
 will be the response value returned by <CODE>
UserDoDialog()</CODE>
 when that trigger is activated. This can be one of the predefined <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
s or an application-defined one with IC_CUSTOM_START. </P>
<P>
The response triggers should also have the attribute GA_SIGNAL_INTERACTION_COMPLETE set to ensure that the dialog will be dismissed when they are activated. (This may be omitted to gain manual control over dismissal over the dialog, but you still must provide a way to dismiss the dialog.) Any response triggers in the dialog should have the hint <CODE>
HINT_SEEK_REPLY_BAR</CODE>
 to place the triggers within the dialog's reply bar, but this is not necessary.</P>
<P>
Because the calling thread is blocked by <CODE>
UserDoDialog()</CODE>

Interaction Commands</H2>
<P>
<A NAME="Menus_14.htm_IX_GenTriggerClass:triggers in dialog boxes">
 </A>
Much of the flexibility of GenInteraction lies in its ability to recognize and process a variety of special <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
s. These commands are data types that the Specific UI and the Interaction can use to decide what actions to take. Depending on the <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
, the UI may perform several pre-defined actions. Much of this functionality is automatic through the inclusion of standard response triggers within a dialog box.</P>
<P>
Some <CODE>
GenInteractionType</CODE>
s provide one or more triggers for your use when the Interaction is built as a dialog box. These default triggers are automatically provided without your needing to create and attach triggers to the Interaction itself. Triggers provided in this manner are known as standard response triggers. Standard response triggers usually appear within an area of the dialog box known as a reply bar. </P>
<P>
Each standard response trigger has a specific <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
 associated with it. These triggers perform their actions by sending out their <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
 with the message <CODE>
MSG_GEN_GUP_INTERACTION_COMMAND</CODE>
 to themselves when activated. The message will travel up the tree to the first GIV_DIALOG Interaction, where it will be handled. See <A HREF="#Menus_15.htm_40133"> InteractionCommand Types</A>

UserDoDialog()</CODE>
 routines. You should never set any custom triggers to this <CODE>

.</LI>
<LI>
IC_DISMISS<BR>
This command instructs the UI to dismiss the Interaction. An Interaction receiving this command will come down whether or not the user has selected the Interaction to remain up (such as by pinning the dialog box). </LI>
<LI>
IC_APPLY<BR>
This command instructs the UI to apply properties selected within a GIT_PROPERTIES Interaction. This <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
 causes <CODE>
MSG_GEN_APPLY</CODE>
 to be sent to the Interaction's children.</LI>
<LI>
IC_RESET<BR>
This command instructs the UI to reset properties within a GIT_PROPERTIES Interaction. This <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
 causes <CODE>
MSG_GEN_RESET</CODE>
 to be sent to the Interaction's children.</LI>
<LI>
IC_OK<BR>
This command instructs the UI to signal an acknowledgment to a GIT_NOTIFICATION Interaction. </LI>
<LI>
IC_YES<BR>
This command instructs the UI to signal a positive response to a GIT_AFFIRMATION Interaction. </LI>
<LI>
IC_NO<BR>
This command instructs the UI to signal a negative response to a GIT_AFFIRMATION Interaction.</LI>
<LI>
IC_STOP<BR>
This command instructs the UI to halt a GIT_PROGRESS Interaction.</LI>
<LI>
IC_EXIT<BR>
This command instructs the UI to exit the application (not just the window). This <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
 is only supported for GenTriggers under GIV_POPUP GenInteractions. This value should only be used with ATTR_GEN_TRIGGER_INTERACTION_COMMAND.</LI>
<LI>
IC_HELP<BR>
This command instructs the UI to bring up the proper help context for this dialog. This value should only be used with ATTR_GEN_TRIGGER_INTERACTION_COMMAND.</LI>

before</EM>
 the trigger's main action has been sent out. Note that this <CODE>

GIV_DIALOG GenInteractions are the most likely recipients of any <CODE>

<P>
<CODE>
MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_ACTIVATE_COMMAND</CODE>
 is a higher-level function. When sent to a dialog GenInteraction with a relevant <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
, it will find the standard trigger for that <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
 and activate it. This can be a Specific UI-supplied trigger or a replacement trigger supplied by the application. If no such trigger exists, the message sends <CODE>
MSG_GEN_GUP_INTERACTION_COMMAND</CODE>
 to perform the default handling. This message is only supported by dialog Interactions.</P>

Standard Response Triggers</H3>
<P>
The Specific UI provides standard response triggers for certain <CODE>
GenInteractionType</CODE>
, when built as dialog boxes. These standard response triggers contain an appropriate <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
 and usually a visual moniker chosen by the Specific UI.</P>
<P>
The standard response triggers (and their visual monikers under OSF/Motif) for each GII<CODE>
_type</CODE>
 are shown in the figure below.
<IMG SRC="Menus_17_response.gif">

</P>
<P>
The Specific UI automatically places these standard response triggers in a reply bar within the dialog. In most cases, you will not have to deal directly with any of these standard response triggers; the Specific UI will create and manage them. In other cases, you must either supply additional response triggers or replace the existing default response triggers. Additional triggers must be supplied for GIT_COMMAND and GIT_MULTIPLE_RESPONSE Interactions. You may replace existing triggers to customize their behavior or even just to change their visual monikers.</P>
<P>
You should add <CODE>
HINT_SEEK_REPLY_BAR</CODE>
 to any additional triggers you supply so that they will be placed in the reply bar area of the Interaction (though this is not necessary). If you add more than one trigger, their order within the Interaction's children will be the order they appear in the reply bar. However, supplemental reply bar triggers will appear to the right of any IC_OK, IC_YES, IC_STOP, or IC_APPLY and to the left of any IC_DISMISS, IC_RESET, or IC_NO trigger.</P>
<P>
Certain triggers may act as default triggers in the reply bar. Default triggers do not need to be explicitly activated (i.e. clicked on) to send out their action. Default triggers may also be activated if the user performs a default activation (normally hitting &quot;Return&quot; or double-clicking on an object within the dialog). Normally this default activation trigger will be the first trigger in the reply bar. Default triggers may be highlighted in some manner by the Specific UI. You can override this behavior by marking any reply trigger of your choosing with the hint <CODE>
HINT_DEFAULT_DEFAULT_ACTION</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
The Specific UI gives <CODE>
HINT_DEFAULT_DEFAULT_ACTION</CODE>
 to the IC_APPLY, IC_OK and IC_YES triggers in any reply bars it creates. (These are normally the first triggers anyway.) For example, the &quot;OK&quot; trigger in a GIT_NOTIFICATION dialog may be activated by either clicking on the trigger or hitting RETURN.</P>
<P>
Whenever a dialog is initially brought on-screen, the trigger marked with HINT_DEFAULT_DEFAULT_ACTION will act as the default activation trigger. However, activating any other trigger will make that trigger the default activation trigger the next time the dialog is brought on-screen. You can avoid this by adding <CODE>
HINT_PREVENT_DEFAULT_OVERRIDES</CODE>
 on the GenInteraction itself. This will allow the <CODE>
HINT_DEFAULT_DEFAULT_ACTION</CODE>
 trigger to always remain the default trigger.</P>

Replacing Default Triggers</H3>
<P>
You may replace a trigger supplied by the Specific UI by adding your own custom GenTrigger (as a child of the GenInteraction) with its <CODE>
ATTR_GEN_TRIGGER_INTERACTION_COMMAND</CODE>
 set to the proper <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
 of the trigger to replace. You should also mark such triggers with <CODE>
HINT_SEEK_REPLY_BAR</CODE>
 to place them within the reply bar, though this is not required. If there is no such hint, the trigger will appear within the body of the dialog. </P>
<P>
You should set the trigger to perform whatever action your application requires (including the function of the trigger being replaced, if applicable). If necessary, the action handler should also perform the default handling of the replaced trigger. A moniker need not be supplied as the Specific UI will choose one based on the <CODE>
InteractionCommand</CODE>
 and the context of the dialog. You may supply your own moniker.</P>
<P>
In fact, in some cases you might want to merely change the default moniker of a standard response trigger without changing the functionality of the trigger itself. In this case, you should provide an override trigger with <CODE>
ATTR_GEN_TRIGGER_INTERACTION_COMMAND</CODE>
. You should then add your new visual moniker to this replacement but leave the action fields blank. The specific UI will assign any trigger set up with <CODE>
ATTR_GEN_TRIGGER_INTERACTION_COMMAND</CODE>
 and a blank action to have the default behavior of the replaced trigger.</P>

Triggers Completing Interactions</H3>
<P>
The <CODE>
GenClass</CODE>
 attribute GA_SIGNAL_INTERACTION_COMPLETE is used to indicate that a response trigger completes a single user interaction within the dialog that contains it. Depending on the context (modality, type, hints) of the dialog, the Specific UI may or may not dismiss the dialog box.</P>
<P>
For example, the &quot;Yes&quot; trigger (IC_YES) in a GIT_AFFIRMATION dialog might dismiss a dialog if the trigger is also marked GA_SIGNAL_INTERACTION_COMPLETE because the user has given the dialog final information. An &quot;Apply&quot; trigger (IC_APPLY) marked GA_SIGNAL_INTERACTION_COMPLETE might not dismiss its dialog because it might be useful to use the dialog to repeatedly apply different properties. This behavior depends on the Specific UI.</P>
<P>
All standard response triggers provided by the Specific UI with the various <CODE>
GenInteractionType</CODE>
, except for the IC_RESET trigger), have GA_SIGNAL_INTERACTION_COMPLETE set. The IC_RESET trigger normally does not indicate the end of user interaction with the dialog and thus should not dismiss the dialog under any circumstances.</P>
<P>
In OSF/Motif, a trigger marked GA_SIGNAL_INTERACTION_COMPLETE will dismiss the dialog containing the trigger if the dialog is not of <CODE>
GenInteractionType</CODE>
 GIT_PROPERTIES or GIT_COMMAND, or if the dialog is modal. A non-modal GIT_PROPERTIES or GIT_COMMAND dialog is not dismissed when its response triggers are activated. If you do wish to dismiss the dialog in such cases, you can mark the dialog box with <CODE>
HINT_INTERACTION_SINGLE_USAGE</CODE>
. This hint tells the Specific UI that it expects the user will only use the dialog box once each time it is brought up. You may also want to do this if the dialog box is infrequently used.</P>
<P>
Similarly, <CODE>
HINT_INTERACTION_FREQUENT_USAGE</CODE>
 allows a dialog to stay up even if one of its GA_SIGNAL_INTERACTION_COMPLETE triggers would normally bring it down. In most cases, however, it is advisable to remove the GA_SIGNAL_INTERACTION_COMPLETE attribute on whichever triggers should not dismiss the Interaction. This is preferred over adding <CODE>
HINT_INTERACTION_FREQUENT_USAGE</CODE>
 because the Specific UI may ignore the hint, but it cannot ignore the state of its GA_SIGNAL_INTERACTION_COMPLETE bit.</P>
<P>
When using <CODE>
HINT_INTERACTION_FREQUENT_USAGE</CODE>
, you should ensure that the dialog is dismissed. In most cases, this can be done by sending <CODE>
MSG_GEN_GUP_INTERACTION_COMMAND</CODE>
 with IC_DISMISS to the Interaction. This can be done in an action handler for a response trigger.<A NAME="Menus_19.htm_marker=361665">
