The visible classes--<CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
, <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
, <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
, and <CODE>
VisTextClass</CODE>
--can be extremely useful to application developers. They provide a flexibility of display and use that is unavailable with the generic UI objects. Among other features, visible objects provide the hooks for and basic functionality of custom drawing, custom input handling, and custom geometry management.</P>
<P>
<CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 is the parent class of all the visible classes and all visible UI objects. <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 objects, by themselves, do nothing; <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 must be subclassed and the objects must be placed in a visible object tree as children of a <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 object. Together, <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 and <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 provide a large amount of the functionality required for creating a hierarchy of non-overlapping objects.</P>
<P>
Many applications will use both <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 and <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 as well as <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
. Before reading this chapter, however, you should be familiar with the concepts of the generic UI and with basic GEOS applications. You should have created a simple application to get familiar with the GEOS system and Goc, and you should be relatively familiar with the GenView.</P>
<P>
You should also become familiar with both <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
 and <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
; both of these classes and their relationship to <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>

Introduction to VisClass</H2>
<P>
<CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 is one of the three visible classes you'll have to have a working knowledge of in order to use visible objects. Both of the others, <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 and <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
, are its subclasses, and both are important in visible object trees. However, <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 provides the heart of the visible world.</P>
<P>
<CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 objects do nothing useful by themselves. When you subclass <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 and add your own methods, however, the real power of the visible classes can be used without the programmer having to worry about the nuts and bolts of most UI issues. These classes inherently provide the following features:</P>
<DL>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Knowledge of Visible Bounds</DT><DD>
</STRONG>
Every visible object has an instance data field that defines the object's bounds in the GEOS graphic coordinate space. These bounds are used for many purposes, including drawing and input handling. See <A HREF="#VisClass_e.htm_87564"> Positioning Visible Objects</A>
.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Comprehensive Visual Updating</DT><DD>
</STRONG>
When a visible object is included in an object tree displayed by a GenView object, the system automatically tells the object when it must redraw itself. For example, when the view scrolls or when part of the window becomes exposed, the system will send a drawing message through the visible tree; the objects then draw themselves at the proper location in the document space, and the view window is updated. See <A HREF="#VisClass_d.htm_28950"> Drawing to the Screen</A>
.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Geometry Management</DT><DD>
</STRONG>
When visible objects are arranged as children of a VisComp or a VisContent object, they can be set up to update their size and position appropriate to the current window and view context. The VisComp and VisContent classes provide extensive and sophisticated child management functions, though custom management is also allowed and is often used. See <A HREF="#VisClass_e.htm_87564"> Positioning Visible Objects</A>
, especially the messages <CODE>
MSG_VIS_RECALC_SIZE</CODE>
 and <CODE>
MSG_VIS_POSITION_BRANCH</CODE>
 in <A HREF="#VisClass_e.htm_16842"> Geometry Management</A>
.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Object Tree Manipulation</DT><DD>
</STRONG>
<CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 objects can not have children, but they can be children of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 and <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
 objects. All of these classes support extensive tree operations including passing messages up the tree, passing messages down the tree, adding branches, removing branches, and moving branches. See <A HREF="#VisClass_10.htm_50052"> Working with Visible Object Trees</A>
.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Mouse Event Handling</DT><DD>
</STRONG>
When an input event occurs over the GenView window in which the visible tree is displayed, that event is immediately passed on to the VisContent object. The event then travels down the visible object tree (automatically) until it is handled by some visible object. Most often, the event is handled by the leaf object with its visible bounds directly under the mouse pointer. Individual Vis objects can also grab the mouse so that they receive input events that occur even outside their bounds. See both <A HREF="#VisClass_f.htm_65723"> Handling Input</A>
 and <A HREF="../../SysObjects/Input/combo.htm">the Input chapter</A>.</DT><P CLASS="WorList">
<STRONG>
Keyboard Event Handling<BR>
</STRONG>
A visible object can grab the keyboard input stream and receive keyboard events as they occur. Typically, certain keystrokes will be intercepted by the specific UI even if a visible object has the keyboard grab; this ensures the object won't usurp functions expected by the user from his specific UI. (The object can, however, override keystroke interception, though this is strongly discouraged.) See <A HREF="../../SysObjects/Input/combo.htm">the Input chapter</A>.</P><DT>
<STRONG>
Interaction with Input Hierarchies<BR>
</STRONG>
<CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 objects have an inherent knowledge of the input hierarchies. Many visible objects may need to interact with the Focus and Target input hierarchies especially, and they can also interact with the Model hierarchy as well. See <A HREF="../../SysObjects/Input/combo.htm">the Input chapter</A>.</DT><P CLASS="WorList">
<STRONG>
Use of VisMonikers<BR>
</STRONG>
Typically, visible objects will draw themselves in their entirety and will not need visual monikers. Monikers are typically labels attached to objects that get displayed either on or near the object. Visual monikers are most frequently used with generic UI objects, but they can be set up and used with visible objects as well. See <A HREF="#VisClass_d.htm_42180"> Using Visual Monikers</A>
.</P>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Standard MetaClass Functions<BR>
</STRONG>
Because <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 is a subclass of <CODE>
MetaClass</CODE>
</DL>
, it inherits all the basic, standard object functions of that class (e.g., state saving, instantiation and initialization, detaching and destruction, etc.). See <A HREF="../../SysObjects/Meta/combo.htm">the MetaClass chapter</A>.</DT><P CLASS="Body">
Many programmers new to object-oriented programming may think that visible objects are used only in certain circumstances. On the contrary, visible objects may be used for nearly any purpose and to provide nearly any application-specific graphical or user interface functions. When used properly, visible objects can relieve you of hours of writing specialized code.</P>
<P>
Programmers new to OOP may need to practice with several small applications in order to gain experience using visible objects. You can also study the sample applications, many of which use visible objects extensively.</P>
<P>
Visible objects are most useful when you have well-defined items that must appear on the screen or interact with the user. Pieces in a board game provide a good example: Each piece has its own visual representation, and each piece has a special set of behaviors that depend on user actions and game context. Therefore, it makes sense to have each piece be an object of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
Another, less immediately obvious, example might be a program that represents maps on the screen. The map itself could be stored as a visible composite object (<CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
), and each of the major subdivisions on the map could be a visible object. For example, in a map of the United States, the country would be a VisComp object, and each state could be a Vis object. Taken one step further, each state could be a composite object, and each county in the state a visible child of the state. Another step turns the counties into composite objects and each town a visible object. This arrangement lends itself to a tree structure, which is how visible objects are stored.</P>
<P>
Another example is a spreadsheet application. The spreadsheet itself could be one composite object containing a number of row objects. Each row object is a composite that holds a number of cell objects. Each cell is a visible object with the functions of the cell built into it. The row and spreadsheet composites can use the geometry manager to arrange the cells properly, thereby making the programmer free of ever having to worry where the cells are in the document. The visible object tree will automatically pass input events to the cell under the mouse pointer. Entire rows can be created, destroyed, drawn, erased, or moved with a few simple commands by the programmer.</P>

Visible Class Tree</H2>
<P>
As stated earlier, the visible class tree consists of four classes. 
<IMG SRC="VisClass_2_classTree.gif">

</P>
<DL>
<DT>
<CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
</DT><DD>This is the parent class of the visible tree. It contains the basic functionality common to every visible object and is the subject of this chapter.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
VisCompClass</DT><DD>
</CODE>
A subclass of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
, this class has the added ability to have and arrange children in the visible tree. It has sophisticated geometry management functions built in and can be used as an organizational object.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
VisContentClass</DT><DD>
</CODE>
A subclass of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
, this class is used only as the content of a GenView. The VisContent has default handlers for many messages sent out by the view, and it interacts with the view window to display the visible object tree. Every visible object tree, to be displayed in a GenView, must have a VisContent as its root object.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
VisTextClass</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This class, not discussed in this chapter, is a visible version of the <CODE>
GenTextClass</CODE>
. It provides a nearly full-featured word processing object that can be put in the visible tree.</DD>

The first three of these classes are used extensively by many applications.

When used at all, these flags are typically set in the object's definition or when the object is first created, and they are rarely changed dynamically by an application. The eight flags in this record are listed below. The record is of type <CODE>
VisTypeFlags</CODE>
.</P>
<DL>
<DT>
VTF_IS_COMPOSITE</DT><DD>
<A NAME="VisClass_5.htm_IX_Objects:composite vis">
 </A>
This flag is set if the object is of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 rather than <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
. This flag indicates the object may have children (normal <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 objects can not have children). Because this is not the only difference between these classes, changing this flag can have unpredictable results.</DD>
<DT>
VTF_IS_WINDOW</DT><DD>
<A NAME="VisClass_5.htm_IX_Windows:VTF_IS_WINDOW">
 </A>
This flag is set if the object creates a window via the window system in order to display itself and its children. This flag implies the object must also have VTF_IS_COMPOSITE set, meaning the object must actually be of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 and not <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
. If this flag is set, the UI will assume that the <CODE>
VI_bounds</CODE>
 field of the object represents the current size of the window. Objects with the VTF_IS_WINDOW flag set are skipped by the normal input and output messages such as <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
 and <CODE>
MSG_META_START_SELECT</CODE>
; these messages will be passed directly to the object's appropriate child. VTF_IS_WINDOW and VTF_IS_PORTAL are mutually exclusive.</DD>
<DT>
VTF_IS_PORTAL</DT><DD>
This flag is set if the object is a portal. A portal is an object that has its own window and appears in its parent's window. A portal differs from a window (VTF_IS_WINDOW) in that the window has no part of itself drawn in its parent window. This flag implies that the VTF_IS_COMPOSITE flag must also be set indicating the object may have visible children. All visible children of a portal will appear in the portal's associated window if VTF_CHILDREN_OUTSIDE_PORTAL_WIN is set. The object itself may display portions of itself within its parent's window, though; an example of this is the UI's implementation of the GenDisplayControl object, which manages several child windows within its own window area. Its border is drawn in the parent window, then its window is defined to be one pixel inside this border. VTF_IS_PORTAL and VTF_IS_WINDOW are mutually exclusive.</DD>
<DT>
VTF_IS_WIN_GROUP</DT><DD>
This flag is set for the top visible object in a visible branch which makes that branch a realizable entity. This flag implies that both VTF_IS_COMPOSITE and VTF_IS_WINDOW must be set as well. An example would be the specific UI's implementation of a GenPrimary object--if the primary is not visible, none of its children may be visible (with some exceptions).</DD>
<DT>
VTF_IS_CONTENT</DT><DD>
This flag is set if the object is the output of a window object. Typically, this will be set only if the object is of <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
 (not for <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 or <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
). Note that if this is set, both VTF_IS_WINDOW and VTF_IS_WIN_GROUP must also be set.</DD>
<DT>
VTF_IS_INPUT_NODE</DT><DD>
This flag is an optimization bit. It is set if the object controls input flow (such as a VisContent) or is a target or focus node that is not a window group (VTF_IS_WIN_GROUP). <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_ALTER_INPUT_FLOW</CODE>
 is sent directly to objects with this bit set unless there is a need for them to actually use the VUP mechanism, as is the case with mouse grabs in a 32-bit content. Similarly, <CODE>
MSG_META_MUP_ALTER_FTVMC_EXCL</CODE>
, <CODE>
MSG_VIS_FUP_QUERY_FOCUS_EXCL</CODE>
, and <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_QUERY_FOCUS_EXCL</CODE>
 are sent to the first visible object up the tree that either is a window group or has this bit set.</DD>
<DT>
VTF_IS_GEN</DT><DD>
This flag is set if the visible object is the specific UI counterpart to a generic object. This flag must be set for the object to handle messages that begin <CODE>
MSG_SPEC</CODE>
. The only objects that will ever have this flag set are those in Specific UI libraries.</DD>
<DT>
VTF_CHILDREN_OUTSIDE_PORTAL_WIN</DT><DD>
This flag is set if children of a portal object may appear in the object's parent window rather than in the portal's specially-created window. The VTF_IS_PORTAL flag must also be set for this object. An example of this is the specific UI's representation of a GenView object and its children; the view's children appear along the edges of the view window rather than inside it. The GenDisplayControl, by contrast, has all its children appearing within its window; thus, it does not have this flag set.</DD>
</DL>
<P>
Although the <CODE>
VI_typeFlags</CODE>
 record will rarely be changed at run-time, you can set new values by sending <CODE>
MSG_VIS_SET_TYPE_FLAGS</CODE>
 to the visible object while it is realized. To retrieve the current type flags, send the object a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_GET_TYPE_FLAGS</CODE>
.</P>

The <CODE>
VI_attrs</CODE>
 field is a record of eight flags (<CODE>
VisAttrs</CODE>
)that determine the general visible attributes of the object. These attributes may be changed on the fly and often are. Applications that don't involve visible tree operations (adding, removing, or moving branches) probably will not change these attributes dynamically.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VisClass_6.htm_IX_VisAttrs">
 </A>
To set the flags after the object has been instantiated, send it a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_SET_ATTRS</CODE>
 with the appropriate flags to be set. To retrieve the <CODE>
VI_attrs</CODE>
 record, send the object a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_GET_ATTRS</CODE>
. The VA_REALIZED flag may not be changed with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_SET_ATTRS</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
The eight flags of the <CODE>
VisAttrs</CODE>
 record are listed below:</P>
<DL>
<DT>
VA_VISIBLE<A NAME="VisClass_6.htm_IX_VA_&ldots;">
 </A>
</DT><DD>This flag is effective only for window group objects (those with VTF_IS_WIN_GROUP set in <CODE>
VI_typeFlags</CODE>
) and is ignored for other objects. If set, it indicates that the visible branch headed by this object can be made visible as soon as it is linked visibly to another visible branch. For example, a window group object may have this bit set and not be on the screen if its parent window group is not set VA_VISIBLE; as soon as the parent window group becomes VA_VISIBLE, though, the entire branch will become visible.</DD>
<DT>
VA_FULLY_ENABLED</DT><DD>
This flag is normally set for visible objects. If it is set, the object is fully enabled when visible on the screen. If not set, the object is not fully enabled--the object will typically be drawn in a 50% pattern (grayed out) and will not receive click events. This flag works even for normal visible objects, though this behavior is seen almost exclusively with generic UI objects.</DD>
<DT>
VA_MANAGED</DT><DD>
This flag indicates that the object's location is managed by its parent. If the flag is set, space is set aside in the parent composite by the geometry manager. When the window displaying this object changes, the geometry will have to be calculated. If this flag is not set, the object can alter its own location and bounds without affecting the parent's geometry.</DD>
<DT>
VA_DRAWABLE</DT><DD>
This flag indicates whether the object is drawn or invisible. If the flag gets set or reset during execution, the rectangle defined by its <CODE>
VI_bounds</CODE>
 field will automatically be marked invalid.</DD>
<DT>
VA_DETECTABLE</DT><DD>
This flag, when set, indicates that the object might respond to mouse, pointer, keyboard, or other similar events. If the flag is reset (such as with display-only objects), its parent composite object will not bother passing it these events. This flag must be set if the object is a window composite. If the status of this flag is changed during execution, the object's grab state will not change. For example, if the object has the mouse grab when a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_SET_ATTRS</CODE>
 resets the flag, the object will retain the mouse grab until it is released or preempted normally.</DD>
<DT>
VA_BRANCH_NOT_MINIMIZABLE</DT><DD>
This flag is used <EM>
only</EM>
 by the visible counterparts of generic UI objects. If set, it indicates that this branch (e.g., a GenInteraction and its children) stays visible and usable even when the parent primary window is minimized.</DD>
<DT>
VA_OLD_BOUNDS_SAVED</DT><DD>
This flag, when set, causes the geometry manager to store the object's old bounds when its <CODE>
VI_bounds</CODE>
 field changes. The old bounds are stored in a TEMP_VIS_OLD_BOUNDS vardata field.</DD>
<DT>
VA_REALIZED</DT><DD>
This flag indicates whether the object is visibly open on the screen--i.e., whether it is positioned on an open window. If the flag is set, the object is visible on the screen. When the object is no longer visible on the screen, this flag is reset. This flag may <EM>
not</EM>
 be altered by <CODE>
MSG_VIS_SET_ATTRS</CODE>
; it may only be changed by <CODE>
MSG_VIS_OPEN</CODE>
 (which sets the flag) and <CODE>
MSG_VIS_CLOSE</CODE>
 (which resets it).</DD>

VOF_GEOMETRY_INVALID</DT><DD>
<A NAME="VisClass_7.htm_IX_VOF_&ldots;">
 </A>
This flag indicates that the general geometry of this object has become invalid (with a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_MARK_INVALID</CODE>
). This is used primarily when an object knows that its bounds must be recalculated or re-verified and that any change must be reflected in its parent window. This flag will be reset when a geometry update resolves the object's bounds. Typically, this will occur with a window update message such as <CODE>
MSG_VIS_UPDATE_WIN_GROUP</CODE>
.</DD>
<DT>
VOF_GEO_UPDATE_PATH</DT><DD>
This flag, also set by <CODE>
MSG_VIS_MARK_INVALID</CODE>
, marks a trail of objects that all must have their geometry updated.</DD>
<DT>
VOF_IMAGE_INVALID</DT><DD>
This flag indicates that the image of the object or the bounds of a windowed object have changed and therefore need to be updated. This flag is set by <CODE>
MSG_VIS_MARK_INVALID</CODE>
. The image redraw will occur the next time one of the window update messages is used on the object's visual branch. This flag will be reset when a visual update redraws the object. Typically, this will occur with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_UPDATE_WIN_GROUP</CODE>
 or another window update message.</DD>
<DT>
VOF_IMAGE_UPDATE_PATH</DT><DD>
This flag, also set by <CODE>
MSG_VIS_MARK_INVALID</CODE>

<DT>
VOF_WINDOW_INVALID</DT><DD>
This flag indicates that the window the object resides in needs to be opened or closed, or that the object itself needs to be opened or closed via <CODE>
MSG_VIS_OPEN</CODE>
 or <CODE>
MSG_VIS_CLOSE</CODE>
. It is set by <CODE>
MSG_VIS_MARK_INVALID</CODE>
. This flag will be reset when a visual update occurs on the window group. Typically, this will occur with a window update message such as <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_UPDATE_WIN_GROUP</CODE>

MSG_VIS_SET_GEO_ATTRS</CODE>
. The flags can be retrieved with a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_GET_GEO_ATTRS</CODE>
. The eight flags in this record are listed below.</P>
<DL>
<DT>
VGA_GEOMETRY_CALCULATED</DT><DD>
This flag indicates whether the object has ever been calculated. If the flag is clear, the object's geometry is about to be calculated. An object may use this flag if it has a particular desired size. This flag is cleared before a geometry recalculation by <CODE>
MSG_VIS_RESET_TO_INITIAL_SIZE</CODE>
.</DD>
<DT>
VGA_NO_SIZE_HINTS</DT><DD>
This flag is used by the Specific UI library to determine whether the object has any sizing hints or not. If the flag is not set, the object has one or more sizing hints (e.g., <CODE>
HINT_INITIAL_SIZE</CODE>
 or <CODE>
HINT_FIXED_SIZE</CODE>
).</DD>
<DT>
VGA_NOTIFY_GEOMETRY_VALID</DT><DD>
If this flag is set, the geometry manager will notify the object when its geometry messages have all been handled and the object's geometry is set. Notification will be in the form of <CODE>
MSG_VIS_NOTIFY_GEOMETRY_VALID</CODE>
. This flag may be used by visual objects for calculations or other sizing once geometry is redone but before redrawing occurs.</DD>
<DT>
VGA_DONT_CENTER</DT><DD>
This flag, when set, allows the object to individually override its parent's centering behavior. The object will instead appear at either the left edge of a vertical composite or the top edge of a horizontal composite.</DD>
<DT>
VGA_USE_VIS_SET_POSITION</DT><DD>
This flag is set to indicate that the object does not use the default handlers for <CODE>
MSG_VIS_SET_POSITION</CODE>
 and <CODE>
MSG_VIS_POSITION_BRANCH</CODE>
. This flag provides an optimization that allows static calls to the geometry manager.</DD>
<DT>
VGA_USE_VIS_CENTER</DT><DD>
If this flag is set, the geometry manager will use the standard <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 or <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 center message to calculate the object's center. Unless an object is using some unusual centering behavior, it should have this flag set. This flag allows the geometry manager to speed up calculations for normal center behavior.</DD>
<DT>
VGA_ONLY_RECALC_SIZE_WHEN_INVALID</DT><DD>
This flag indicates that the object's size should be recalculated only when its geometry is marked invalid. That is, once the object's geometry is calculated, it will always return the same size until its geometry is once again marked invalid. Because the geometry manager often queries objects for their sizes, most objects should have this flag set. It allows the geometry manager to speed up calculations.</DD>
<DT>
VGA_ALWAYS_RECALC_SIZE</DT><DD>
This flag avoids optimizations that do not recalculate the object's size when passed its current size. Though not often used, this flag may be needed in certain situations (e.g., when a composite object must expand to fit and center its children).</DD>

Basic VisClass Rules</H3>
<P>
To use visible objects, you must subclass the Vis classes and create a visible object tree. Otherwise, the visible objects will not be able to display themselves or accept user input, the two things that make visible objects worthwhile.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VisClass_c.htm_IX_VisClass:displaying">
 </A>
Nearly all visible objects you use will at least display themselves on the screen. Some may accept mouse or keyboard input; some may move themselves around the screen, resize themselves, or implement custom geometry management functions.</P>
<P>
For a subclass of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 to display itself on the screen, it must handle the message <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
. This message is sent to all visible objects in a given window when that window is subjected to an exposure event. In addition, the object must be part of a tree of visible objects, the top node of which is connected to a GenView or other windowed object. Displaying a basic visible object is discussed below.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VisClass_c.htm_IX_VisClass:input">
 </A>
For a visible object to handle mouse input, it will need to handle a subset of the mouse event messages. Typically, a visible object will want to know when the mouse is clicked within the object's bounds (<CODE>
MSG_META_START_SELECT</CODE>
) and when the mouse button is released (<CODE>
MSG_META_END_SELECT</CODE>
). Other messages dealing with mouse motion or other mouse buttons may also be of interest to the object. In addition, visible objects may request and handle Ink input. Handling of these messages is discussed in <A HREF="#VisClass_f.htm_65723"> Handling Input</A>
.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VisClass_c.htm_IX_VisClass:tree management">
 </A>
Most applications using visible object trees will add objects to and remove them from the trees. <CODE>
MSG_VIS_ADD_CHILD</CODE>
 and <CODE>
MSG_VIS_REMOVE</CODE>
 are the two messages used most often for tree management. When an object should be freed, it can be destroyed with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DESTROY</CODE>
, which will remove it from the tree and then free it.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VisClass_c.htm_IX_VisClass:geometry">
 </A>
Some applications will want to use the built-in geometry management features of GEOS. The geometry manager can automatically resize and reposition an entire visible object tree properly according to pre-set constraints. (The constraints can also be changed at run-time.) How the system manages visible object geometry is discussed in <A HREF="#VisClass_e.htm_16842"> Geometry Management</A>
.</P>
<P>
The geometry manager, though extremely useful for non-overlapping objects, may not be sufficient for all the needs of a complex application. For an object to determine its own size and position, it has to handle some of the messages sent out by the geometry manager. You can also manually set the size and position of each visible object. This is discussed in <A HREF="#VisClass_e.htm_87564"> Positioning Visible Objects</A>
.</P>
<P>
Often applications may need to change something about a visible object or the tree it's in. When this happens, the application must force a visual update by invalidating either the geometry or the image (or both) of the object and then calling <CODE>
MGS_VIS_VUP_UPDATE_WIN_GROUP</CODE>
. To mark any object invalid, the application must call <CODE>
MSG_VIS_MARK_INVALID</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
Many visible objects will have specific functions they perform. For example, if the user presses on a menu item labeled &quot;New Game&quot; or something similar, the visible object may return itself to its original location (as in the TicTac sample application). To get this type of functionality, you must define new messages for your subclass of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 and have the object handle them. In the case of the TicTac game pieces, each piece handles the <CODE>
MSG_PIECE_NEW_GAME</CODE>
 message by resetting the object's position to its original position.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VisClass_c.htm_IX_VisClass:tree management">
 </A>
Visible objects are maintained and managed in a tree structure. The tree has three basic elements: The root (topmost) node must be an object of <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
. Any nodes in the middle of the tree, nodes that are allowed to have children, must be of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
. Any leaf nodes (guaranteed not to have children) may be of either <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 or <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
. (Subclasses of the above classes may also be used.)</P>
<P>
The visible object tree is displayed normally through a GenView object. The output of the GenView must be tied directly to the top node of the visible object tree; this is why the visible tree must be headed by a VisContent--only the VisContent has the methods to handle GenView messages.
<IMG SRC="VisClass_c_visAndGen.gif">

</P>
<P>
The VisContent object may or may not do things other than manage the visible tree. For example, the content may draw some background graphics to the window before the other visible objects draw themselves, or it may implement some special geometry behavior to arrange its children.</P>
<P>
The VisContent can have children. These children can be either standard visible objects or <EM>
composite</EM>
 visible objects. Composites, like the content, are allowed to have children. For efficiency, standard visible objects can not have children. Therefore, only leaf objects in the tree may be of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
The visible object tree may have any number of layers of composites. You should pay attention to the functions required in your application and fit the structure of the tree to the application's needs.</P>
<P>
These restrictions, combined with the link to the generic object tree through GenView, result in an object tree structure somewhat like that shown in the figure above. Of course, the actual generic and visible tree structure will vary from application to application. Also, note that the generic and visible sections are actually two different object trees; they are not connected through a parent-child relationship anywhere.</P>

Drawing to the Screen</H3>
<P>
One of the main features of visible objects is their ability to draw themselves on the screen. The visible tree does not have to detect when drawing or redrawing should be done; the UI will do this automatically through the window system and the GenView object.</P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
<A NAME="VisClass_d.htm_90026">
 </A>
Visual Updates</H4>
<PRE>MSG_VIS_OPEN, MSG_VIS_CLOSE</PRE>
<P>
The visible tree will have to draw or redraw itself when a portion of its GenView window becomes newly exposed. The GenView keeps track of its window and will notify its content when any portion of the window becomes exposed. Exposure can occur from several events: The view window could be newly created; another window could have been moved, exposing the view's window; or the view window could have been scrolled.</P>
<P>
Each of these exposure events looks exactly the same to the visible tree. When one of them occurs, the GenView will send a <CODE>
MSG_META_EXPOSED</CODE>
 to its content object. The content (a VisContent or GenDocument if you're using a visible tree) will create a GState for the window and translate the <CODE>
MSG_META_EXPOSED</CODE>
 into a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
. It will then send this <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
 to itself.</P>
<P>
The default handler for <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
 in a composite is to simply pass the message on to all of the composite's children. There is no default behavior for <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
 in <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
Any object (content, composite, or leaf) that wants to represent itself on the screen must handle <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
. Any composite that subclasses this message must be sure to pass it on to all of its children with the following line:</P>
<PRE>@send @visChildren::<A NAME="VisClass_d.htm_IX_MSG_VIS_DRAW"> </A>MSG_VIS_DRAW(drawFlags, gstate);</PRE>
<P>
Redrawing is not initiated only by the view window becoming exposed. It can also be initiated by some portion of the visible tree changing so that it needs to be redrawn (e.g., a child is moved from one composite to another, which may have an effect on the visual representation of the composite). Typically, any change that necessitates a redrawing will automatically generate a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
 to the appropriate objects. These operations, however, will require a <CODE>
VisUpdateMode</CODE>
 to be passed along with the other parameters.</P>
<P>
All of the above assumes that the visible object is &quot;open&quot; or &quot;realized.&quot; If an object is not open, it will not appear on the screen or as part of a composite's geometry calculations. When a window is first created, the window's content is automatically opened with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_OPEN</CODE>
. In the case of a visible tree attached to a GenView, this means that the VisContent object will be opened along with the window. All of the VisContent's children will also be opened automatically (assuming their VOF_WINDOW_INVALID bits are set, which is true the first time a visible object comes up).</P>
<P>
If a visible object is added to an already-opened composite, the child will automatically be opened and marked invalid. This will cause the composite's geometry and image to be updated during the next visual update. If a child is added to a composite that is not currently open, the child will not be opened.</P>
<P>
Although it is rarely done directly, you can manually open a visible object with the message <CODE>
MSG_VIS_OPEN</CODE>
, and you can &quot;close&quot; an object (remove it from the screen and from the tree's geometry calculations) with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_CLOSE</CODE>
. To open or close an entire branch of the visible tree, you can send the appropriate message to the top composite object in the branch. The message will propagate down through all the visible children.</P>

This message travels up the visible tree until it gets to a window group (an object with its VTF_IS_WINDOW flag set), and then it creates a GState associated with that window object. Sometimes a content object will subclass this message to set up its own display information before the GenView window can create the new GState. The other time in which this message may be subclassed is by a content that manages a 32-bit graphics space; the content will have to translate the gstate to the proper position in the large document before letting other objects use it.</P>

<P>
If your visible tree contains a composite that manages its own children, chances are you'll need to force a visual update after certain changes occur. For example, if you have an object that can be moved with the mouse, it will probably want to erase its image and redraw itself somewhere else after the move; since the geometry manager is not involved here, the object must force a redrawing of the affected portion of the visible tree.</P>
<P>
There are several ways an object can force a redraw. These all take the form of messages, each of which is described below.</P>
<DL>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message causes the entire visible branch to draw itself. This message may be sent by any object to any other object, including itself. It does not, however, update the screen image; you must call <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_UPDATE_WIN_GROUP</CODE>
.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_BOUNDS_CHANGED</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message causes the visible object to mark the affected portions invalid, causing the visual update mechanism to redraw that portion during the next visual update. This message is part of the visible update mechanism.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_REDRAW_ENTIRE_OBJECT</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message causes the visible object to redraw itself entirely (as opposed to just the invalid portion) if it is currently drawable. Essentially, the object will send itself a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
 when it receives this message. This is especially useful if an object needs to completely change its image.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_INVALIDATE</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message invalidates the entire region inside the visible object's bounds. It will cause the window system to generate a <CODE>
MSG_META_EXPOSED</CODE>
 for the affected area, causing a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
 to propagate down the tree to all affected objects. Note that this message must be subclassed to work with scaled windows or large documents.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_INVAL_TREE</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message invalidates the entire region inside the visible object's bounds, including any child window areas. The window system will generate a <CODE>
MSG_META_EXPOSED</CODE>
 for all affected windows.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_MARK_INVALID</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message allows the caller to set an object's invalid flags so the object will be properly updated later. The object is marked as being invalid, and the default handler ensures a visual update path is created. This method may <EM>
not</EM>
 be subclassed by applications.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_ADD_RECT_TO_UPDATE_REGION</DT><DD>
</CODE>

 </A>
A window group is an object that has a window in which visible objects are displayed. Typically, you will not create your own window group objects, but you may need to notify a window group when it needs to be updated visually. To be a window group, an object has to have its VTF_IS_WINDOW or VTF_IS_PORTAL flag set in its <CODE>
VI_typeFlags</CODE>
 field.</P>
<P>
The window group is responsible for keeping track of the regions of its coordinate space that require visual updating. When a region or object gets invalidated, the window group remembers that it is invalid and makes sure it gets updated during the next visual update.</P>
<P>
Any object can request that a visual update occur for the entire branch managed by a window group. It can use the three messages described in this section to request or force a visual update for the window group.</P>

Positioning Visible Objects</H3>
<P>
Every visible object has an instance data field called <CODE>
VI_bounds</CODE>
 that records the object's visible bounds. Visible bounds are the left, top, right, and bottom bounds of a rectangle that define the maximum area covered by the visible object. The bounds are used primarily for determining the object's size and location.</P>
<P>
The <CODE>
VI_bounds</CODE>
 field is a <CODE>
Rectangle</CODE>
 structure, provided by the graphics system. This structure has four components, as shown below:</P>
<PRE><A NAME="VisClass_e.htm_IX_R_&ldots;"> </A><A NAME="IX_Rectangle data structure"> </A>typedef struct {
    sword   R_left;    /* x of upper-left corner */
    sword   R_top;     /* y of upper-left corner */
    sword   R_right;   /* x of lower-right corner */
    sword   R_bottom;  /* y of lower-right corner */
} Rectangle;</PRE>
<P>
The bounds of non-window objects are stored in document coordinates relative to the document displayed by the window in which they appear. The left and top bounds constitute the position of the object. The difference between the right and left bounds is the object's width; the difference between bottom and top is its height. Together, the width and height constitute the object's size.</P>
<P>
The bounds of a window or portal object (VTF_IS_WINDOW or VTF_IS_PORTAL) represent the location of the window, in document coordinates, within its parent window. The coordinate system within the window object is independent from that of its parent.</P>
<P>
Unless an object's bounds are set in the Goc code, they will be set at zero and must be initialized to some values before the object can be drawn. This initialization can be done with the messages that set position and size, or it can be done automatically by the geometry manager (if a composite is managing its children).</P>
<P>
The <CODE>
VI_bounds</CODE>
 instance field exists in <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 and therefore occurs also in <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 and <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
 and all their subclasses. Any object can directly set any or all of its bounds; other objects (such as a parent VisComp) can direct the object to set its bounds to certain coordinates as a result of either geometry management or some user action. For example, a VisComp that has ten children may recalculate their positions if one of those children gets resized; the composite must then notify all the children of their new positions. To learn how a composite object can manage its children in different ways, see <A HREF="../../UI/VisComp/combo.htm">the VisComp chapter</A>.</P>

An object's bounds determine both the location and the size of the object in the document space. The object may reposition itself or resize itself at will; for example, it may allow the user to move or resize it with the mouse. The object can also receive direction from other objects that it should change its bounds. Note that none of these messages by themselves will cause the object to redraw; you must also send a <CODE>

<P>
<A NAME="VisClass_e.htm_IX_Geometry:VisClass messages">
 </A>
Geometry management consists of positioning and sizing visible objects properly. This can be done manually by the programmer or automatically by GEOS. If you wish to manually control your visible tree's geometry, set the flag VCGA_CUSTOM_MANAGE_CHILDREN in the top composite's <CODE>
VCI_geoAttrs</CODE>
 field (see <A HREF="../../UI/VisComp/combo.htm">the VisComp chapter</A>). You can then use any messages, either native to <CODE>VisClass</STRONG>
 or defined by your subclasses, for object positioning and sizing.</P>
<P>
Automatic geometry management occurs when the geometry of the visible tree is marked invalid somewhere and a visual update is initiated. The tree's geometry can be marked invalid in several ways--an object can be added to or removed from the tree, an object can be manually marked invalid (with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_MARK_INVALID</CODE>
), or an object can be opened or closed (<CODE>
MSG_VIS_OPEN</CODE>
 or <CODE>
MSG_VIS_CLOSE</CODE>
).</P>
<P>
When automatic geometry management is invoked, the geometry manager will recalculate the entire affected branch's geometry. It will calculate geometry for each affected window group, from the topmost affected window object down to the bottommost affected object. If the geometry manager encounters window groups below the topmost window, it will check first to see if the lower window's size is controlled by its children (e.g., a GenView that follows the geometry of its content). If the lower window is scrollable or otherwise not subject to its children's geometry, the geometry manager will finish calculating the geometry above the lower window before proceeding.</P>
<P>
Calculating geometry is an involved, complex task. The process involves composites and their children negotiating on desired sizes. How the geometry is calculated depends primarily on the relationships between the objects and how their flags are set.</P>
<P>
For example, if a GenView is set up to be exactly the same size as its VisContent object, the calculations will be different than if the GenView were scrollable. The same is true for visible composites that manage their children: If the composite resizes itself large enough to hold all its children, the children must be resized first.</P>
<P>
The negotiation between parent and child in the visible tree takes the form of a single message: <CODE>
MSG_VIS_RECALC_SIZE</CODE>
. This is the single most important message in calculating the tree's geometry, though others are also significant. This message is sent by a composite to each of its children in turn; it passes a suggested size, and the child returns its desired size.</P>
<P>
The composite collects all the desired sizes of its children and compares that to the size it thinks it should be. If necessary, it makes another pass through the children, or it passes on its desired size to its parent composite. Depending on the situation and the disparity between parent and children sizes, the geometry calculation may take a single pass or several. If the sizes can not be resolved through this negotiation, the geometry manager will make a decision after several passes, typically expanding the parent as much as possible to fit all the children.</P>
<P>
After a visible object has calculated its size, its size will be set either by itself or by its parent. Often this is done with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_SET_SIZE</CODE>
. Once all sizes have been determined and set, the objects set their positions with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_POSITION_BRANCH</CODE>
, which propagates down the tree. It sets the position of the topmost composite and then sets each of its children's positions appropriately.</P>
<P>
When geometry calculations are complete, the geometry manager will send a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_NOTIFY_GEOMETRY_VALID</CODE>
 to all visible objects with the flag VGA_NOTIFY_GEOMETRY_VALID set in its <CODE>
VI_geoAttrs</CODE>
 field.</P>
<P>
Several other messages may be used during geometry updates. Some of them may be intercepted to alter the behavior of the default method. These messages are listed below. Others can be used to invalidate a visible object's geometry or to cause a geometry update on the tree.</P>
<DL>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_UPDATE_GEOMETRY</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message is typically called by the UI during a window group update. It calculates the geometry of the entire branch receiving it. It's not likely you'll subclass this method--altering its behavior can be used for certain optimizations, however.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_NOTIFY_GEOMETRY_VALID</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message will be sent to an object when all its geometry messages have been handled and its geometry has been fully resolved (at least for the moment). This message will be sent only if VGA_NOTIFY_GEOMETRY_VALID is set in the object's <CODE>
VI_geoAttrs</CODE>
 field. There is no default behavior for this message; it should be intercepted only if the object needs to do calculations after the geometry has settled down.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_RECALC_SIZE</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message is normally sent by the geometry manager to a composite object. The composite is expected to send it to all its children; the children will then determine their sizes, and the composite will figure the total size and return. A composite that manages its own children can also use this message to query its children for their desired sizes.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_RECALC_SIZE_AND_INVAL_IF_NEEDED</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message is an optimized <CODE>
MSG_VIS_RECALC_SIZE</CODE>
. Composites should use this version when sending a recalculation message to their children. This message only causes recalculation if needed and will invalidate the object if the size gets recalculated. It invalidates the object's image at its old bounds and only invalidates its geometry if the bounds change. It is highly unlikely that you'll subclass this method.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_GET_CENTER</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message returns the amount of space on each side the object wants reserved for itself. It does not, as the name suggests, return the coordinates of the object's center. Instead, it returns the distance in each direction the object requires (you may think of it as external margins).</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_RESET_TO_INITIAL_SIZE</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message propagates down the visible tree and causes every object that receives it to reset itself to its original size. It does this by clearing VGA_GEOMETRY_CALCULATED in the object's <CODE>
VI_geoAttrs</CODE>
 field, causing the object to believe it is being put on-screen for the first time. This message will also set the object's flags to indicate that its geometry has become invalid. It's highly unlikely your application will subclass this method.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_POSITION_BRANCH</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message is sent by the geometry manager when an entire visible branch should be repositioned. If an application wants to do something special, it should subclass the handler for this message. Typically, though, only subclasses of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 and perhaps <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
 will change this method.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_POSITION_AND_INVAL_IF_NEEDED</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message is an optimized <CODE>
MSG_VIS_POSITION_BRANCH</CODE>
 that causes a branch reposition only if it's necessary. It will also invalidate both the object's and the parent's original images and, if the position changes, the geometry as well. It is highly unlikely that you'll subclass this method.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_INVAL_ALL_GEOMETRY</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message invalidates all geometry under the recipient object, forcing invalidation of all children. This is a brute-force message used only when absolutely necessary.</DD>

Handling Input</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="VisClass_f.htm_Input">
 </A>
Input events, what they mean, and how they are generated are discussed fully in <A HREF="../../SysObjects/Input/combo.htm">the Input chapter</A>. The visible world has some default behavior for handling input messages such as <CODE>MSG_META_START_SELECT</CODE>
, <CODE>
MSG_META_END_SELECT</CODE>
, and <CODE>
MSG_META_PTR</CODE>
. For the most part, however, visible objects that want to respond to input must subclass and handle the input messages that interest them.</P>
<P>
Composite objects will automatically pass mouse messages on to the proper child directly under the mouse pointer. Non-composite objects (direct subclasses of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
) have no special default behavior for input handling.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VisClass_f.htm_IX_Objects:overlapping">
 </A>
Note that <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 does not intelligently handle layering of objects. That is, if one object is visibly on top of another object, it will not necessarily receive the input events--the events may be passed to the partially hidden object. This is due to the order in which drawing and mouse events are handled by a visible object's children.</P>
<P>
Take the example of a visible composite with two children. Each child draws a filled rectangle covering its bounds; the first child has a width and height of 40, and the second child has a width and height of 20. The composite's declaration shows</P>
<PRE>    ...
    VCI_comp = LargeChild, SmallChild;</PRE>
<PRE>    ...</PRE>
<P>
Because drawing occurs in the order the children are listed, the small child will be drawn over the large child, as shown in the figure below. If each object can intercept and handle mouse events (e.g., <CODE>
MSG_META_START_SELECT</CODE>
), clicks will never reach the small object without special behavior added to the composite. This is because input events are handled in the same order as drawing; the input event will be given to the first child whose bounds include the event's coordinates.
<IMG SRC="VisClass_f_drawingOrder.gif">

</P>
<P>
So, a click event on (10, 10), which is in the middle of the small square, would first be passed to the LargeChild object. The large child would see that the click was within its bounds, and it would take the event. The event would never be handled by the small object.</P>
<P>
Therefore, if you need to have overlapping objects which handle user input, you will have to add special features for bounds detection. In the example of the two squares, if neither were to move, the composite could simply pass the event to the small child first and then to the large child, assuming the small child is always on top. If the objects could be moved forward and back so they hide each other, the composite (or the objects themselves) will need some other, more complex, detection behavior.</P>

<P>
Composite objects will automatically pass mouse messages on to the first child directly under the mouse pointer. Non-composite objects (direct subclasses of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
) have no special default behavior for input handling.

</P>
<P>
Typically, a visible object that needs to handle mouse input will subclass <CODE>
MSG_META_START_SELECT</CODE>
 (or one of the other press events such as <CODE>
MSG_META_START_MOVE_COPY</CODE>
). This message is sent when the user presses on the &quot;select&quot; mouse button while the pointer is over the object. In this method, the object should grab the mouse (as shown below). When it has the mouse grab, it will receive <CODE>
MSG_META_PTR</CODE>
 each time the mouse is moved; the object should subclass this message to provide the desired reaction to mouse moves. Finally, when the user releases the select button, the object will receive a <CODE>
MSG_META_END_SELECT</CODE>
. At this point, it should release the mouse grab.</P>
<P>
Typically, mouse events will arrive with coordinates specified in 16 bits. This is the default graphics space, and it represents a coordinate system more than 25 yards on a side. Nearly all applications will find this graphic system big enough for their uses. However, if you need larger coordinates, you can use the large document space with 32-bit coordinates. To do this, you must set the GVA_WINDOW_COORDINATE_MOUSE_EVENTS in the <CODE>
GVI_attrs</CODE>
 field of your GenView object and set up your visible objects correctly. For more information on supporting 32-bit graphic spaces with visible objects, see <A HREF="#VisClass_16.htm_45302"> Visible Layers and 32-Bit Graphics</A>

<P>
When an object &quot;grabs the mouse,&quot; it requests that the UI send all future mouse events directly to that object. Normally, mouse events will travel down the visible object tree until they reach either the leaf object under the pointer or an object under the pointer that handles them. When an object has the mouse grab, the mouse events will go to the object with the grab regardless of the location of the pointer.</P>
<P>
Typically, if an object wants to receive mouse events, it will subclass <CODE>
MSG_META_START_SELECT</CODE>
. This message is sent to the object when the pointer is over the object's bounds and the user presses the select button. In this handler, the object grabs the UI's gadget exclusive and then grabs the mouse. A good example of this can be found in the TicTac sample application's handler for <CODE>
MSG_META_START_SELECT</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
After an object grabs the mouse, it receives all pointer and drag events that occur. These are primarily <CODE>
MSG_META_PTR</CODE>
 messages, and the object must subclass <CODE>
MSG_META_PTR</CODE>
 to achieve the proper behavior it wants. When the user lets go of the select button, the object will receive a <CODE>
MSG_META_END_SELECT</CODE>
. If it grabbed the mouse (which it probably did if it receives this message), it must relinquish both the gadget exclusive and its mouse grab.</P>
<P>
An example of getting and releasing the mouse grab (taken from the TicTac sample application) is shown in <A HREF="#VisClass_f.htm_90374"> Grabbing and Releasing the Mouse</A>
. The object subclasses these messages to let the user drag it around the screen.</P>
<P>
The UI allows the visible object to get the normal mouse grab by using four different messages. Each of these is detailed below. If you're using a large document (32-bit coordinates), you will use the &quot;large&quot; mouse grabs. Otherwise, the normal mouse grab messages will do.</P>

 *		MSG_META_START_SELECT for TicTacPieceClass
 ***********************************************************************
 * SYNOPSIS:		Grabs the mouse and calls for future pointer events.
 * 		When the user clickes in the view, TicTacView will pass
 * 		the click event to TicTacBoard. Since TicTacBoardClass
 * 		does not intercept the event, VisContentClass passes
 * 		it on to its child object currently under the pointer.
 * PARAMETERS:
 * 	void	(MouseReturnParams *retVal,
 *		 word xPosition, word yPosition, word inputState);
 *
 * STRATEGY:		When the piece object receives this message, it means
 * 		it has been clicked on by the user and the mouse button
 * 		is still down. The piece must grab the mouse so that it
 * 		gets all future mouse events, and it must request that
 * 		all future mouse events be sent to it. This ensures
 * 		that if the pointer leaves the object's bounds while
 * 		the button is still pressed, the piece object will still
 * 		receive all the pointer events (otherwise they would be
 * 		sent to whatever object was under the new pointer position).

 * SYNOPSIS:		This message is received when the selection button has

 * 		It first checks to see if the new, proposed bounds are
 * 		on the game board. If the bounds are valid, then
 * 		it sets the objects VI_bounds field to the new values
 * 		and causes the object to erase its original drawing
 * 		and draw itself at its new bounds. If the bounds are
 * 		not on the game board, it will retain the original bounds
 * 		and redraw using them.
 * PARAMETERS:		void ();

<P>
The type of mouse grab described in the previous section is also known as an &quot;active&quot; mouse grab. An object can also have two other types of mouse grabs: <EM>
pre-passive</EM>
 and <EM>
post-passive</EM>
. While only one object may have the active mouse grab at any given time, any number of objects may have pre- or post-passive grabs on the mouse.</P>
<P>
An object with a pre-passive mouse grab receives a copy of the input event before the event goes to its true destination. The copy will be a message of the form <CODE>
MSG_META_PRE_PASSIVE_...</CODE>
 (e.g., if the event is <CODE>
MSG_META_PTR</CODE>
, the pre-passive event is <CODE>
MSG_META_PRE_PASSIVE_PTR</CODE>
). All pre-passive events will be handled before the true event is delivered to the object with the active grab. If any of the pre-passive copies of the event is returned with the flag MRF_PREVENT_PASS_THROUGH, the active event will not be sent to its destination. You can use this feature to set up input filters, having an object receive all mouse events pre-passive and filtering out those that should not be delivered. The message <CODE>
MSG_VIS_REMOVE_BUTTON_PRE_PASSIVE</CODE>
 removes any pre-passive mouse grab from the object.</P>
<P>
A post-passive mouse grab is similar to a pre-passive except that the post-passive object receives the event <EM>
after</EM>
 it is sent to its normal destination. The post-passive object will receive a <CODE>
MSG_META_POST_PASSIVE_...</CODE>
 with the same flags and position information as sent with the input event. An object that has the post-passive grab can release it by sending itself a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_REMOVE_BUTTON_POST_PASSIVE</CODE>
.</P>

The <EM>
gadget</EM>
 <EM>

 is a marker in the system used by the UI to indicate which object has exclusive access to input gadget functionality. Only one gadget at a time may have the gadget exclusive, and the gadget exclusive may be forcibly taken from an object by another object (for example, when a system-modal dialog comes up during a drag operation).</P>
<P>
At times, an object will force the mouse input to go to a different object from that which has the current active grab. This is done almost exclusively by the Specific UI library and is rarely, if ever, done by applications. Three messages can be used in determining which object has the current &quot;gadget exclusive,&quot; or active mouse grab. These are shown below.</P>

In addition, individual objects can get information about the current state of the Focus hierarchy with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_QUERY_FOCUS_EXCL</CODE>

, also shown below.</P>
<P>
To deal with a quick-transfer operation, a visible object may also have to use the message <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_ALLOW_GLOBAL_TRANSFER</CODE>

Visible objects can not be used unless they are placed within object trees. The top object of the tree must be of a subclass of <CODE>

<P>
Each visible object has a <CODE>
VI_link</CODE>
 instance field. This field specifies the optr of that object's next sibling in the tree. Since this is a field of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>

VCI_comp</CODE>
 field which contains the optr of the composite's first child. Thus, visible trees use the same format as normal object trees.</P>

Creating and Destroying</H3>
<PRE>MSG_VIS_DESTROY</PRE>
<P>
Visible objects are just like any other objects in the ways they are created and destroyed. You can create visible objects in many ways; the easiest is to set them up in a resource and simply load or duplicate the resource block at run-time. You can also use the <CODE>
ObjInstantiate()</CODE>
 routine to instantiate new visible objects on the fly from your predefined subclass of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
, <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
, or <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
. <A HREF="../../Programming/GOCLanguage/combo.htm">the GEOS Programming chapter</A> details how to instantiate a new object of a given class.</P><P>
Destroying visible objects is very simple. You only need to use the message <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DESTROY</CODE>
, which works on a visible object and all its children (if it has any). This message removes the visible branch from the screen if necessary, detaches the visible objects from the visible tree, and then destroys the object (freeing its instance chunk). The only thing the object must do is clean up after itself--in its <CODE>
MSG_META_DETACH</CODE>
 or <CODE>
MSG_META_FINAL_OBJ_FREE</CODE>
 handler, it should free any memory that it allocated explicitly for its own use, for example.</P>
<P>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_DESTROY</CODE>
 also marks the destroyed object's parent invalid both in geometry and image so the tree will be updated properly.</P>

<P>
Once you have objects instantiated, you can connect them together into an object tree. If you know the structure of your tree beforehand, you can create the tree explicitly in your <STRONG CLASS="fileName">
.goc</STRONG>
 file, just as you would create your generic object tree.</P>
<P>
For many purposes, however, a dynamic object tree is much more useful. To use it, you must be able to add and remove objects easily as well as move them within the tree easily.</P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Adding and Removing Normally
<IMG SRC="VisClass_12_addVisChild.gif">

</H4>
<P>
To add an object to a branch of a visible tree, use the message <CODE>
MSG_VIS_ADD_CHILD</CODE>
. This message adds a visible object as the child of a composite; if the new child is a composite with its own children, the entire branch is added to the tree. You can add a child at any position in the composite's child list (e.g., as the first child, as the second child, as the last child, etc.), and you can mark the child dirty after addition if you want.</P>
<P>
For example, if you have a composite visible object with two children that is currently unattached to any visible tree, you can attach it to a tree with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_ADD_CHILD</CODE>
. The figure above shows this process and the line of code used to add the composite as the second child of an object in the tree.</P>
<P>
Note that the child in the example is added as child one. The child list of a composite is zero-based, so the first child is referred to as number zero, the second is number one, and so on. The last child may always be referred to as CCO_LAST; likewise, the first child may always be referred to as CCO_FIRST.</P>
<P>
To remove an object or branch from a visible tree, you can use either <CODE>
MSG_VIS_REMOVE</CODE>
 or <CODE>
MSG_VIS_REMOVE_CHILD</CODE>
. <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DESTROY</CODE>
 may also be used, but only if the entire branch should be destroyed after being removed from the tree. Both <CODE>
MSG_VIS_REMOVE</CODE>
 and <CODE>
MSG_VIS_REMOVE_CHILD</CODE>
 detach the object from the visible tree and visually update the parent immediately. <CODE>
MSG_VIS_REMOVE</CODE>
, however, should be sent directly to the object being removed, while <CODE>
MSG_VIS_REMOVE_CHILD</CODE>
 is sent to the parent of the object being removed. When removing a child from its parent, you can specify the child by position number (e.g., remove the last child or the first child).</P>
<P>
You can move a child within its child list with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_MOVE_CHILD</CODE>
. This message is sent to the parent and simply moves the child within the parent's child list. To move a child from one parent to another, you must first remove it and then add it to the other parent with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_REMOVE_CHILD</CODE>
 and <CODE>
MSG_VIS_ADD_CHILD</CODE>
. This message, as the others, will move the child's entire branch with it.</P>

Adding and Removing Objects Not Saved to Documents</H4>
<P>
<A NAME="VisClass_12.htm_IX_Documents:visible objects in;Objects:non-discardable">
 </A>
In many cases, you may save visible objects directly to VM documents using GenDocument objects and the document controllers. In cases like this, the objects you save to the file <EM>
must not</EM>
 be discarded by the UI if the visible object is taken off the tree or removed. These objects are known as &quot;non-discardable&quot; visible objects stored in a VM file, and unless they're handled specially, they can cause your documents to crash your application.</P>
<P>
Any top-level object you save directly to a file must be treated as non-discardable. That is, any object that gets dynamically added to or removed from a visible tree (such as a vis object that gets added as the child of a GenDocument when the document is opened) must be added, removed, and managed as a non-discardable object. There are three messages that deal specifically with non-discardable visible objects; these are detailed below and are <CODE>
MSG_VIS_ADD_NON_DISCARDABLE_VM_CHILD</CODE>

MSG_VIS_REMOVE_NON_DISCARDABLE_VM_CHILD</CODE>

Sending Messages Through the Tree</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="VisClass_14.htm_IX_Classed events:with visual objects">
 </A>
Often an object will need to contact its parent or children but will not know their precise optrs. Other times, you may need to send a message to a particular object in the tree but don't know where in the tree the object is. GEOS provides several ways to dispatch messages to parents and children and even to objects of a given class.</P>

Contacting Parents and Children Directly</H4>

<P>
<A NAME="VisClass_14.htm_IX_Messages:calling parents;Messages:calling children">
 </A>
To send a given message to an object's parent (to check valid bounds, to check the parent's state, etc.), you can use the macro <CODE>
@visParent</CODE>
. To do this, substitute the macro in place of the destination object's name, as follows:</P>
<PRE>kids = @call @visParent::MSG_VIS_COUNT_CHILDREN();</PRE>
<P>
The above call is more efficient than using two message calls for the same thing, as follows:</P>
<PRE>myParent = @call self::MSG_VIS_FIND_PARENT();
kids = @call myParent::MSG_VIS_COUNT_CHILDREN();</PRE>
<P>
Note that either <CODE>
@call</CODE>
 or <CODE>
@send</CODE>
 may be used with the <CODE>
@visParent</CODE>
 macro.</P>
<P>
A similar macro, <CODE>
@visChildren</CODE>
, is offered for sending messages to a composite's children. Note, however, that you can only use the <CODE>
@send</CODE>
 keyword to send messages with this macro; there is no way for a single call to collect return values from many different objects. So, if you need to pass pointers to your children, you will have to get each child's optr in turn and dispatch the message to it individually. (Recall that pointers should not be passed with <CODE>
@send</CODE>
 because they may be invalidated by the time the message is handled.) The format for using the <CODE>
@visChildren</CODE>
 macro is as follows:</P>
<PRE>@send @visChildren::MSG_VIS_INVALIDATE();</PRE>
<P>
This usage is much more efficient than counting the composite's children and using a loop to get the child's optr and send the child the message.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="VisClass_14.htm_IX_Messages:recorded events">
 </A>
In addition to providing the above macros, <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 lets you pass recorded events to a visible object's parent or children. This can be useful, for example, if you need to send a message to another object's parent; you might otherwise first have to find the optr of the object's parent and then send the message directly. Instead, you can use the <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 messages <CODE>
MSG_VIS_CALL_PARENT</CODE>
 and <CODE>
MSG_VIS_SEND_TO_PARENT</CODE>
 to pass recorded (encapsulated) events to the recipient's parent.</P>
<P>
To send a recorded event to a visible object's children use the message <CODE>
MSG_VIS_SEND_TO_CHILDREN</CODE>

@visChildren</CODE>

<P>
To find an object of a given class in the tree, use the message <CODE>

If you need to send a message to an object of a given class in the visible tree, you can either find it and send it the message or send the message directly with the visible upward messages <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_CALL_OBJECT_OF_CLASS</CODE>

You can create your own messages that get passed up the visible tree by creating aliases of <CODE>

. <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_QUERY</CODE>
, by itself, does nothing useful; it simply gets passed up the visible tree without ever being handled.</P>
<P>
You can create your own visible queries to return different types of values from objects higher up in the object tree. Take, for example, a music-teaching application which uses note objects as distant children of a sheet music object. If the note objects needed to know what key they were supposed to be in, they would query up the tree with a special upward query message. If we assume the sheet music object kept this information, it would want to respond to the query message with the appropriate value. Thus, the sheet music class would have a line similar to the following:</P>
<PRE>@alias(MSG_VIS_VUP_QUERY)
        MusicKeyType MSG_VIS_VUP_QUERY_MUSIC_KEY();</PRE>
<P>
This line creates an alias for the general-purpose upward query. The sheet music object should have a handler for <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_QUERY_MUSIC_KEY</CODE>
 in which it figures out and returns the appropriate key. This type of upward query can be invaluable in many different situations.</P>

<A NAME="VisClass_16.htm_IX_Documents:large model">
 </A>
The GEOS graphic space is built on a basis of 16-bit coordinates. A few applications, however, will require much more space for their documents. GEOS also supports the special use of 32-bit coordinates; applications using these coordinates are said to be using the &quot;large document&quot; model.</P>
<P>
The visible object library was originally designed with 16-bit coordinates in the default GEOS graphics space. All instance data, message parameters and return values, and coordinates are assumed to be word-sized integers. A large-document visible object library is not provided primarily because there is no single visible model that works well with large coordinates, and also because no single large model works efficiently for all applications.</P>
<P>
It is possible, however, for applications to subclass the standard visible classes in order to get them to support the large document model. In order to do this, however, you must understand the basic issues involved with the large model and with using 32-bit coordinates.</P>
<P>
As the application developer, you should read the following sections if you will be using the large document model. Each one deals with a different problem facing applications that want large documents.</P>
<P>
In addition, some complex applications may offer several different visible layers in the program. For example, a spreadsheet might want to include a graphic object layer for graphics and charts. The content object of the visible tree can be set up to have several different children, each of which is a &quot;layer&quot; that manages its own objects in the window.</P>
<P>
The content in charge of the layers must occasionally set and retrieve the document bounds of its children. For example, if the user wants to set the page size of the spreadsheet that has a graphical layer, the content object must set the new size for all its children. To retrieve the current document bounds of a particular object, send it a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_LAYER_GET_DOC_BOUNDS</CODE>
. To set the document bounds, send a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_LAYER_SET_DOC_BOUNDS</CODE>
. In addition, the application may add or delete space into a layer with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_LAYER_INSERT_OR_DELETE_SPACE</CODE>
; for example, if a spreadsheet needs to resize a column, it must send this message to the graphic layer to ensure the layers handle the sizing properly.</P>

 </A>
<A NAME="VisClass_17.htm_IX_Objects:layered objects">
 </A>
The first issue with large documents is the basic structure of the visible tree. The topmost object of a large visible tree must be able to keep track of information about the current translations and coordinates being used. Typically, the topmost object would be a subclass of <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
; this does not change with large trees, though another consideration has to be taken care of.</P>
<P>
A content object should not contain any information about the document itself; the content object should not be stored along with other document information. Thus, the object that acts as the content can not be the object that also manages the 32-bit document space. Instead, it is easiest to use a <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 object to manage the document space and to place this object as a child of the content.
<IMG SRC="VisClass_17_largeDrawing.gif">

</P>
<P>
In addition, you can set up several different composite children of the content, each one managing its own large document space. Each one of these composites is called a &quot;layer object&quot; and manages a &quot;layer&quot; of the document. This way, you can have several different layers (such as a spreadsheet layer and a graphic layer) in the same document. The layer object should manage the calculations and translations necessary for supporting the large document space.</P>

Using 16-Bit Drawing Commands</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="VisClass_18.htm_IX_Drawing:in 16 bits">
 </A>
All the GEOS drawing commands are based on 16-bit coordinates. Drawing may only occur within a 16-bit graphics space. The graphics system does, however, support extended translations of the 16-bit graphics space within 32-bit coordinates.</P>
<P>
This means that you can think of the large document space as a number of smaller, 16-bit &quot;local&quot; graphics spaces. When you need to draw anything, you first use an extended translation to get near your drawing point in the large document. Then you can draw using 16-bit offsets from the point to which you translated. </P>
<P>
The application using the extended translation can do so in two different ways: It can store a 32-bit translation with each visible object, or it can store a 32-bit translation in a visible composite, thereby making the entire visible branch under the composite in a 32-bit graphics space. Visible trees implementing layer objects must use the second option; the layer must contain the translation for the entire visible branch that it manages. If a simple large visible tree does not need layers, it may wish to use the first solution.</P>
<P>
The first of the two solutions is simple but takes up additional memory and time; each object, when it draws, must translate the coordinates, draw, then translate back. Two translations for each object could significantly affect drawing performance unless visual updates are handled carefully.</P>
<P>
The other solution, storing a translation in the composite object, requires just two translations for the entire branch headed by the composite. Whenever the composite receives <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
 or <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_CREATE_GSTATE</CODE>
, it executes the translation on the GState. As long as the translation is always relative to the GState's current transformation (done using <CODE>
GrApplyTranslationDWord()</CODE>
), and as long as the translation is undone before the GState is returned to the caller, drawing will be done properly.</P>

The 16-Bit Limit on Visual Bounds</H3>
<P>
Individual visual objects have 16-bit bounds. If the rules of drawing in the 32-bit graphics space are followed, this is not a problem. Individual objects are constrained to 16-bit width and 16-bit height, however.</P>
<P>
The only objects for which having 16-bit bounds is a problem are the tree's content object and all the layer objects. This is because these two types of objects must have width and height greater than 16 bits. This problem is handled differently for each object:</P>
<P>
For the content object, the <CODE>
VI_bounds</CODE>
 field is set to all zeros and is not used. Normally, the content uses its bounds to set the document size in the GenView; the responsibility for setting the GenView's document size then falls to the application.</P>
<P>
For the layer object, the <CODE>
VI_bounds</CODE>
 field is set to all zeros and is not used. If the bounds of the layer object are important to the application, the layer object must be given new instance fields to hold the 32-bit coordinates of the bounds. If not, nothing needs to be done; the bounds can simply be ignored.</P>

In normal-sized visible trees, <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
 gets sent to all objects in the tree. This draws the entire visible tree, no matter what portions are visible on the screen. For large documents, this can quickly get unwieldy and inefficient.</P>
<P>
A better solution is for the layer object of each particular layer to intercept <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
 and pass it on only to those objects in the affected portion of the document. For this to work, of course, the layer object must know something of the structure and composition of the visible branch below it.

Because visible objects and composites maintain their 16-bit bounds in a large document, they can still use the 16-bit geometry manager. Layer objects, however, can not use the geometry manager.

<A NAME="VisClass_1c.htm_IX_Input:large mouse input;Mouse:in 32 bits">
 </A>
The GenView is built to support large documents, though its default is normal-sized documents. Thus, you can request the view to send large mouse events, which carry with them 32 bits of integer and 16 bits of fraction in each dimension. The visible classes have no default handlers for these messages, so your own classes will have to handle them appropriately.</P>
<P>
The large mouse events are the equivalent of their 16-bit counterparts. They just carry different data to represent the coordinates of the pointer. All the mouse events, both large and normal, are described in <A HREF="../../SysObjects/Input/combo.htm">the Input chapter</A>.</P><P>
Normal composite objects will not be affected by large mouse events; the composite will continue to send the event on to the proper child as if it were in a 16-bit document. Layer and content objects, however, must process these messages differently.</P>
<P>
If no object within the visible tree has the mouse grabbed, the content of the tree must decide which layer object should receive the mouse events. How the content and layer objects negotiate this is up to the particular application; some applications may consider that one layer is &quot;on top of&quot; the others, and other applications may determine which layer is the most appropriate based on the event context. By default, the large mouse events are passed by <CODE>

Setting Up the Objects</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="VisClass_1d.htm_IX_Objects:in 32 bits">
 </A>
Finally, you should be aware of what attributes to set in both the GenView and the VisContent objects of your visible tree to support the large document. You could easily find this out by looking through the various attributes of those classes (and you are encouraged to do so), but the following guide is provided for convenience:</P>
<P>
In the GenView object, set GVA_WINDOW_COORDINATE_MOUSE_EVENTS in the <CODE>
GVI_attrs</CODE>
 instance data field. This will pass mouse events in terms of offsets from the upper-left corner of the view window rather than in absolute document coordinates. <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
 handles these events and automatically turns them into document coordinates.</P>
<P>
In the VisContent, set VCNA_WINDOW_COORDINATE_MOUSE_EVENTS and VCNA_LARGE_DOCUMENT_MODEL in the <CODE>
VCNI_attrs</CODE>
 field. The first of these tells the content that it will receive input events in window coordinates rather than in document coordinates. The second will have the effect of making the content object ignore its bounds field and geometry management. It will also tell the content that all its children are layer objects. Setting the large document model will cause the content to send all the following messages on to all its children rather than handle them directly: <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
, <CODE>
MSG_VIS_CONTENT_VIEW_ORIGIN_CHANGED</CODE>
, <CODE>
MSG_VIS_CONTENT_VIEW_SCALE_FACTOR_CHANGED</CODE>
, and <CODE>
MSG_VIS_CONTENT_VIEW_SIZE_CHANGED</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
You do not have to create all the objects you may need; be aware that the Graphic Object Library provides its own layer object that supports a 32-bit graphic object layer. The spreadsheet object also exports its own layer object.</P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Requirements of Layer Objects</H4>
<P>
Layer objects will need to handle <CODE>
MSG_VIS_LAYER_SET_DOC_BOUNDS</CODE>
, which will be sent to all layers when the document bounds change.</P>
<P>
In essence the layer object's job is to isolate its children and their children from the fact that they are in a 32-bit document rather than a 16-bit document. In order to do this, layer objects must do several things:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Store the translation<BR>
This is a set of 32-bit translation offsets. These offsets represent the current location, if any, where the layer is being drawn in the 32-bit coordinate space.</LI>
<LI>
Intercept <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW<BR>
</CODE>
In its handler, the layer should apply any 32-bit translations (using <CODE>
GrApplyTranslationDWord()</CODE>
<A NAME="VisClass_1d.htm_IX_GrApplyTranslationDWord():in MSG_VIS_DRAW">
 </A>
) on the GState provided by <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
. It should then intelligently select which of its children are affected by the drawing event and pass the message on to them with the translated GState. The handler should then untranslate the GState before returning.</LI>
<LI>
Intercept <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_CREATE_GSTATE<BR>
</CODE>
In the handler, the layer must <EM>
first</EM>
 call its superclass (to create the GState normally), then apply the necessary translation using <CODE>
GrApplyTranslationDWord()</CODE>
. It can then return the translated GState.</LI>
<LI>
Intercept and handle large mouse events<BR>
Each large mouse event that may be interesting to the layer must be handled by the layer object. This is to ensure that mouse events that occur when no object has the mouse grab get handled. If the layer has 16-bit visible children, it should translate the mouse event into small mouse events before passing it to its superclass. If the layer has 32-bit visible children, it should first translate both mouse coordinates and then decide which of its large children should receive the event.</LI>
</UL>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Requirements of 32-bit Visible Objects</H4>
<P>
Large visible objects in the visible tree should be equipped to handle both large and small mouse events. This is because the parent object may have both 32-bit and 16-bit children. If it does, it will have to send out only small mouse events; otherwise, the 16-bit objects would be confused by the large mouse events.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Requirements of 16-bit Visible Objects</H4>
<P>
Because 16-bit objects are the norm and not the exception, there are few requirements for them. However, 16-bit objects in 32-bit documents must do one thing: they must prevent the system from allowing the user to select the object and then drag-scroll too far. To prevent this from happening, the visible object must call <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_SET_MOUSE_INTERACTION_BOUNDS</CODE>
 to set a temporary boundary on drag scrolling.</P>

Creating Specific UIs</H2>
<P>
It is possible, using visible object classes, to create your own specific UIs. It is a complex and difficult task, however, and only very few developers will expect to do this. Documentation on creating a custom specific UI may appear either in a future release of this documentation or under separate cover. Contact Geoworks Developer Products for more information.</P>

Basic Summary</H2>
<P>
Visible objects are involved in several basic operations, each of which has its own primary messages:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Drawing<BR>
Vis objects must handle <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
 (<A HREF="#VisClass_d.htm_63045"> MSG_VIS_DRAW</A>
) if they are to draw after their window has been exposed. Objects wishing to redraw themselves outside of exposure events can call <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_CREATE_GSTATE</CODE>
 (<A HREF="#VisClass_d.htm_32272"> MSG_VIS_VUP_CREATE_GSTATE</A>
) to create a GState in their view windows for drawing.</LI>
<LI>
Being added to an object tree<BR>
When an object is added to a visible tree, it must then force a redraw of the tree. It can be added to the tree with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_ADD_CHILD</CODE>
 (<A HREF="#VisClass_12.htm_93265"> MSG_VIS_ADD_CHILD</A>
), and the tree can be updated with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_UPDATE_WIN_GROUP</CODE>
 (<A HREF="#VisClass_d.htm_83286"> MSG_VIS_VUP_UPDATE_WIN_GROUP</A>
).</LI>
<LI>
Being removed from an object tree<BR>
A visible object may be removed from a visible tree with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_REMOVE</CODE>
 (<A HREF="#VisClass_12.htm_64862"> MSG_VIS_REMOVE</A>
). This message will close the object (take it off the screen) and then segregate it from its parent.</LI>
<LI>
Undergoing visual update<BR>
The visual update mechanism is automatic for the most part. An object that requires visual update, however, can use <CODE>
MSG_VIS_MARK_INVALID</CODE>
 (<A HREF="#VisClass_d.htm_69779"> MSG_VIS_MARK_INVALID</A>
) in conjunction with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_UPDATE_WIN_GROUP</CODE>
 (<A HREF="#VisClass_d.htm_83286"> MSG_VIS_VUP_UPDATE_WIN_GROUP</A>
) to cause the update.</LI>
<LI>
Geometry management<BR>
Geometry management of visible objects can be as simple as setting a few flags in the instance data or as complex as manually setting position and size of the objects. For a full description of geometry management of visible objects, see <A HREF="#VisClass_e.htm_87564"> Positioning Visible Objects</A>
.</LI>
<LI>
Being Destroyed<BR>
Visible objects may be destroyed even when they are part of a visible tree that is on the screen. <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DESTROY</CODE>
 (<A HREF="#VisClass_11.htm_85965"> MSG_VIS_DESTROY</A>
) first removes the object from the tree (with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_REMOVE</CODE>
) and then destroys it (through the <CODE>
MetaClass</CODE>
 detach and destroy mechanisms).</LI>
