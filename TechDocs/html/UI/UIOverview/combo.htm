UI Overview

</H1>
<P>
The GEOS user interface (UI) is an integral part of the system software and does an amazing amount of work for applications. The UI is a sophisticated and powerful object library that includes everything from simple buttons to self-scrolling windows to plug-in objects that provide nearly complete word processing.</P>
<P>
GEOS also uses a new concept in user interface technology: the generic UI. By using the generic UI, GEOS programs simply declare their UI needs and leave nearly all drawing, screen management, and input management up to GEOS. The generic UI technology also allows a single application executable file to run with several different look-and-feel specifications.</P>

<H2 CLASS="sectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">UI Overview</A>: 1 
The GUI</H2>
<P>
Ever since the first text-based computer application was created, computer users have looked for easier, more intuitive interfaces to their programs. If the user has to struggle to remember commands or to find the right function, the program is of very little use to him. Thus, the user interface of a program, the program's look and feel, can often be as important as its feature set.</P>
<P>
The graphical user interface (GUI) concept has prompted millions of people to begin using computers and has made computer use for millions of others easier. Many corporations and school systems even make GUI a requirement for all their computer acquisitions.</P>
<P>
GUIs, however, are not without problems. With so many hundreds of different programs available, even well-designed interfaces can differ significantly from other well-defined interfaces. Although users no longer have to remember whether the &quot;print&quot; command is Ctrl-Alt-P or F4, they may have to search through dozens of menus just to find it. To solve this consistency problem, different manufacturers have created GUI specifications that detail menu structure, color schemes, input management, and many other aspects of the GUI.</P>
<P>
GEOS takes this one step further with its Generic User Interface. Application programmers do not have to decide beforehand which GUI specification will be run by their program; nor do they have to write one version for each GUI supported. Instead, they define their generic UI needs and then let GEOS determine the manifestation of those needs at run-time.</P>
<P>
Another problem with GUIs is their speed. Without powerful hardware, many GUI-based systems are sluggish because of high overhead associated with geometry management and drawing. GEOS, however, is extremely fast because it is entirely object-oriented and is programmed in assembly language. And, since most of the user interface is managed and drawn by GEOS, applications written for the system automatically take advantage of this speed.</P>

<H2 CLASS="sectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">UI Overview</A>: 2 
The GEOS User Interface</H2>
<P>
Most programmers who write applications for GEOS will have worked with other GUI systems. Some will even have worked with object-oriented systems. Using the GEOS UI, however, will be a new experience for nearly every programmer.</P>
<P>
The GEOS user interface consists of a number of dynamic libraries containing object classes. Applications include objects of these classes to gain various types of functionality. In general, applications will use two different basic types of objects for their UI: Generic objects provide basic UI functionality including windows, menus, and dialog boxes, and their implementation on the screen is determined by GEOS. Visible objects provide more application-specific functionality and offer complete display control to the application.</P>
<P>
Generic object classes are all based on the class <CODE>
GenClass</CODE>
. Applications will never use any objects of <CODE>
GenClass</CODE>
, but they will use many objects of its subclasses. A list of these subclasses is shown below, and each of these classes is described in <A HREF="#UIOverview_3.htm_55547"> Using the Generic Classes</A>
.</P>
<P>
Visible object classes are subclassed from <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
. <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 may be used often by applications, as will its subclasses. The subclasses of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 are shown below, and each is described in <A HREF="#UIOverview_6.htm_59519"> Using the Visible Classes</A>
.
<IMG SRC="UIOverview_2_genHier.gif">

</P>
<P>
When to use the generic or visible objects is subject to many criteria. In order to learn more about each of these components of the UI, you should read the two sections following this one.</P>
<P>
The GEOS UI also contains many features that will often be used by applications but which don't fall into either the generic or the visible world. These features are called &quot;mechanisms&quot; and include input management, geometry management, general change notification, and the clipboard and quick-transfer functions. As these mechanisms are not UI-specific but are only implemented within the UI libraries, they are documented elsewhere in this book.

<A NAME="UIOverview_3.htm_55547">
 </A>
Using the Generic Classes</H2>
<P>
<A NAME="UIOverview_3.htm_IX_Generic objects">
 </A>
Most of your application's UI needs will be satisfied by the use of generic UI objects. Many applications may need only the generic classes. Generic UI objects are powerful and easy to use, and they provide a number of services normally left up to application code.</P>
<P>
Generic object classes have no inherent visual representation. Rather, each generic object represents a certain set of UI functions instead of UI components. For example, the GenInteraction class implements grouping and organizational functions; it can appear in several forms including menus and dialog boxes. It can also have no visual representation but merely provide geometry management for other generic objects.</P>
<P>
What visual form a generic object takes, if any, is determined by two factors: the specific UI library in use, and the instance data of the generic object.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
A specific UI library is essentially a &quot;UI driver&quot; that translates the generic class into its specific representation. Just as each video card has its own driver, each UI specification (e.g. OSF/Motif or Presentation Manager) has its own specific UI library. This library uses the generic object's instance data to determine the exact form of that object's output and input. A GenValue object, for example, may be implemented as a spinner object in one specific UI but as a slider object in another. </LI>
</UL>
<P>
The generic object's instance data determines the features of the object as implemented by the specific UI. Across different GUI specifications, each similar object may appear different or handle input differently. For example, a button in one GUI may invert itself when pressed while the same button in another GUI might simply darken its outline when pressed. However, both buttons will do the same task. Therefore, a generic object's instance data must be categorized into two types: <EM>
Attributes</EM>
 are instance data that will cause the same results no matter what GUI is used (e.g. the function the button performs). <EM>
Hints</EM>
 are instance data that suggest particular implementations that may or may not be implemented by the GUI in use.</P>
<P>
The way the generic object gets translated by GEOS into a visible representation is a complicated process. All generic classes are subclasses of <CODE>
GenClass</CODE>
, which is defined as a variant class. This means that <CODE>
GenClass</CODE>
 has no defined superclass, that the superclass can be changed from time to time. The superclass is determined when the object is instantiated and resolved--when its visual representation is called for. (See <A HREF="../../Programming/GOCLanguage/combo.htm">the GEOS Programming chapter</A>.)</P><P>
The specific UI library contains objects subclassed off <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
. These objects know how to handle input events and have very specific representation on the screen. These specific UI classes connect to the generic classes through the master/variant mechanism; in this way, the superclass of a generic object is assigned to one of the classes in the specific UI library. The generic object thus inherits the specific class' visible representation.</P>
<P>
The above process happens entirely at run-time. The application does not have to have any knowledge of which particular GUI is in use; the same application executable code will work with any specific UI library. Because of the generic UI of GEOS, a user can run the same application under several look-and-feel specifications; this is desirable to the programmer because he only has to code the application once to receive the benefits of several different GUIs.</P>

<A HREF="#index.htm">UI Overview</A>: 3.1 <A HREF="#UIOverview_3.htm">Using the Generic Classes</A>: 
The Generic Class Tree</H3>
<P>
Generic objects have a tremendous amount of built-in functionality. Much of this is built into <CODE>
GenClass</CODE>
, the topmost class in the generic class tree. For full details on <CODE>
GenClass</CODE>
 and the other generic classes, see the Object Reference Book.</P>
<P>
Among the features offered by all generic classes are</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Visual Representation<BR>
Through the specific UI library, every generic object provides its own visual representation. The application does not have to do any gadget drawing.</LI>
<LI>
Monikers<BR>
Every generic object can have a moniker, which is a name or graphic that gets displayed along with the object.</LI>
<LI>
Input Management<BR>
Through the specific UI library, every generic object properly handles mouse and keyboard input.</LI>
<LI>
Messaging<BR>
As with all objects in the system, generic objects can receive and send messages. In addition, generic objects can pass messages up or down the generic object tree automatically.</LI>
<LI>
Enabled and Usable States<BR>
Generic objects understand their usable and enabled states. If an object is not enabled, it may be visible but the user cannot invoke its action. If an object is not usable, it will not be visible on the screen (in most specific UIs). Entire object trees can be set usable or enabled with one command.</LI>
<LI>
State Saving<BR>
Generic objects automatically save their state when the system shuts down. Therefore, when the system comes back up, dialog boxes and windows will automatically be restored to the same state they were left in when shut down.</LI>
<LI>
Object Tree Management<BR>
All generic objects must be part of a generic object tree to be displayed. Generic objects inherently understand the tree structures and functions. UI gadgetry can dynamically be added, moved, or removed.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Each of the different generic classes is described in overview depth below. Note that every one of these classes may be subclassed to add, change, or remove functionality. Changing or removing functions from a generic class is not encouraged, however, as it can cause a specific UI library to give unpredictable results. </P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenClass</H4>
<P>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenClass">
 </A>
<CODE>
GenClass</CODE>
 provides the functionality basic to all generic objects. <CODE>
GenClass</CODE>
 is not used directly by any applications and has no visible representation. Rather, all generic classes are subclassed off <CODE>
GenClass</CODE>
. <CODE>
GenClass</CODE>
 provides instance fields common to all of its subclasses. Instance fields of special interest include</P>
<UL>
<LI>
links between parents and children, providing the means of constructing a generic tree.</LI>
<LI>
text or graphics strings to serve as an object's visual moniker.</LI>
<LI>
a keyboard accelerator to activate an object through keyboard events.</LI>
<LI>
a state field relating to the usable state of an object.</LI>
<LI>
an attributes field relating to other default behavior, such as how the object handles busy states when an application is waiting for a routine to finish.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
GenClass also implements scores of hints that can affect UI geometry, visual representation, data structures, and functions.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenApplicationClass</H4>
<P>
<CODE>
GenApplicationClass</CODE>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenApplicationClass:overview">
 </A>
 provides the basic functionality to open and close applications within GEOS. An object of this class serves as the top object in any application for GEOS.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenPrimaryClass</H4>
<P>
<CODE>
GenPrimaryClass</CODE>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenPrimaryClass:overview">
 </A>
 is a subclass of <CODE>
GenDisplayClass</CODE>
. The GenPrimary is the chief UI grouping object of an application, and it usually appears as the application's primary window. An application's GenPrimary object manages all controls and output areas that are invoked when an application is first launched. You will usually create a GenPrimary as the sole child of your GenApplication object.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenTriggerClass</H4>
<P>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenTriggerClass:overview">
 </A>
A GenTrigger is a simple pushbutton that executes an action when activated by the user. Typically, the trigger will have a moniker displayed within it and will be activated by a mouse click or by a special keystroke sequence. GenTriggers are very common in applications.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenInteractionClass</H4>
<P>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenInteractionClass:overview">
 </A>
GenInteraction objects are essentially grouping mechanisms. GenInteractions are the key objects for creating both menus and dialog boxes, and they can be used to organize the geometry of other generic objects. Typically, a GenInteraction will have a number of children, each of which will appear within the interaction on the screen. The Interaction itself may or may not have a visible representation.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenViewClass</H4>
<P>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenViewClass:overview">
 </A>
The GenView object provides a scrollable window in which the application has complete drawing control. Most applications will use a GenView, and many will use it in conjunction with a VisContent object. The View is extremely powerful, providing all clipping, scrolling, resizing, and scaling automatically. A View can even be splittable or linked to other views. The GenView can display either normal graphic documents or hierarchies of visible objects. </P>

 </A>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenBooleanClass:overview">
 </A>
Together, GenBoolean, GenBooleanGroup, GenItem, GenItemGroup, and GenDynamicList provide many different types of lists. List objects may be used to create lists that are dynamic or static; scrollable or not; exclusive, non-exclusive, or otherwise. List objects may appear within menus or dialog boxes as well as within an application's primary window.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenValueClass</H4>
<P>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenValueClass:overview">
 </A>
The GenValue object allows the user to set a value within a particular range. This may be implemented as a slider, a spinner, or a pair of up/down buttons next to the value. Ranges may use scalar or distance values and can have their maximum and minimum values set by the application.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenTextClass</H4>
<P>
<CODE>
GenTextClass</CODE>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenTextClass:overview">
 </A>
 is tremendously versatile and can be used for text displays or text-edit fields. The GenText is used by nearly every application that either displays text or requires text input. It is so versatile and powerful that it can provide the power of an entire word processor without any additional code in the application.</P>
<P>
The GenText object supports selection and control of fonts, point sizes, text color, paragraph color, paragraph borders, margin settings, tab stops, manual leading, and character kerning, as well as several other features. The text library also provides several controllers that work with the GenText to allow the user to set all these features.</P>

Document and Document Control Classes</H4>

<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenDocumentControlClass:overview">
 </A>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenDocumentGroupClass:overview">

<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenDocumentClass:overview">
 </A>
Together, <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
, <CODE>
GenDocumentGroupClass</CODE>
, and <CODE>
GenDocumentControlClass</CODE>
 provide all the functions necessary to create, save, open, and edit document files. These classes provide not only the UI menus and tools (the File menu) but also the functions for managing the document files. Applications that use these classes never have to call routines to open, close, or save files--all that is done automatically, including the file selector mechanisms to aid the open and save-as functions.</P>
<P>
GenDocument objects are created and managed automatically by the GenDocumentGroup. Each document object represents a single file which has been opened or newly created by the user.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Display and Display Control Classes</H4>
<P>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenDisplayControlClass:overview">
 </A>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenDisplayGroupClass:overview">
 </A>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenDisplayClass:overview">
 </A>
Together, the GenDisplay, GenDisplayGroup, and GenDisplayControl provide display windows and the UI gadgetry to manage them. Typically, these objects will be used in conjunction with the document and document control objects to provide one display for each document.</P>
<P>
The GenDisplayGroup object creates and manages multiple GenDisplay document windows. The GenDisplayControl object creates and maintains a Window menu to allow the user to operate on the individual displays. If your application will have multiple documents or multiple displays open, you will want to use these objects.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenControlClass and UI Controllers</H4>
<P>
<CODE>
GenControlClass</CODE>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenControlClass:overview">
 </A>
 is used to create UI controller objects. Applications will most likely not use <CODE>
GenControlClass</CODE>
 directly, though some object libraries might. For example, the Text Library uses controller objects for font control, point size control, and style control, among other things. Any application that uses the Text Library can include the font controller object; the user will then be able to select and apply fonts without the application having to do any work to support it.</P>
<P>
The UI and various libraries provide many controllers you can use immediately. Some examples are the <CODE>
GenEditControlClass</CODE>
, which creates and maintains the Edit menu and tools; <CODE>
ColorSelectorClass</CODE>
, which creates and displays UI gadgetry to set color information; and <CODE>
GenViewControlClass</CODE>
, which creates and maintains a View menu allowing the user to set scaling and scrolling behavior.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenToolControlClass</H4>
<P>
<CODE>
GenToolControlClass</CODE>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenToolControlClass:overview">
 </A>
 lets the user select which of an application's tools are available and where they should be placed (in a toolbox, in a menu, etc.). Tools are provided by UI controllers. Typically, an application that uses controllers will provide several tool areas and a GenToolControl; the GenToolControl will automatically create all the UI gadgetry to let the user select which tools are active and where they will appear.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenFileSelectorClass</H4>
<P>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenFileSelectorClass:overview">

The GenFileSelector provides user interface to allow the user to navigate through his or her file system. It is used most often by the document control objects and is used directly by only some applications.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenGlyphClass</H4>
<P>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenGlyphClass:overview">
 </A>
GenGlyph displays simple text or graphics strings. Text displayed by a Glyph object is not selectable or editable; these objects are typically used for labeling areas or items on the screen.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenContentClass</H4>
<P>
<CODE>
GenContentClass</CODE>
<A NAME="UIOverview_4.htm_IX_GenContentClass:overview">

Visible Objects and the GenView</H3>
<P>
Visible objects are designed for flexibility and for interacting with the user. Typically, visible objects will reside in an object tree, the root of which is a VisContent or GenDocument object connected to a GenView (this section assumes the VisContent, though the GenDocument is roughly equivalent for the purposes of overview). The relationship between these objects is simple, yet it accomplishes an immense amount of work for the application.</P>
<P>
The GenView provides a window that may be scrollable, scalable, and resizable. The view is directly connected to the VisContent object and works very closely with it to handle input and drawing events. The VisContent acts as a manager for the visible object tree; it passes input events (mouse moves and mouse clicks) on to the proper visible object directly under the mouse pointer, and it makes sure all visible objects in the tree draw themselves at the appropriate time.</P>
<P>
The view and VisContent may be connected tightly or very loosely for sizing purposes. For example, the view may be forced to resize itself to the proper size of the VisContent; or, the view might be scrollable and resizable independent of the content's size. The VisContent can choose whether mouse events are expected or required, and the view will notify the VisContent whenever the window has been invalidated and the document needs redrawing.</P>

<P>
<A NAME="UIOverview_8.htm_IX_VisContentClass:overview">
 </A>
Visible objects exist in an object tree and draw themselves in the GEOS graphic space. Every visible object knows where in the graphic coordinate space it sits and how big it is. The top object of the object tree, the VisContent, manages the entire tree. Composite objects (of class <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
) can be used as organizational objects that control other objects.</P>
<P>
Using the VisContent, the VisComp, and the standard Vis objects, you can create just about any interactive document you want. (There are other available object libraries such as the spreadsheet and ruler libraries, and they are based on these three building blocks.)</P>
<P>
Every visible object knows what its bounds are; that is, each object knows exactly how big it is and where it sits in the graphics document. The bounds are always rectangular in the base <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 format, though a subclass of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 could easily be created to handle more complex shapes. Bounds are in the standard graphics coordinates (i.e. 16-bit numbers based on a 72 dpi grid). Vis objects may also exist in large documents (32-bit coordinates), but the objects must handle the majority of the extra coordinate manipulation on their own.</P>
<P>
Visible objects do not inherently know how to draw themselves. However, the GenView, when resized or scrolled (for example), will send <CODE>
MSG_META_EXPOSED</CODE>
 to the VisContent. The VisContent object will then send a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
 message to itself and to all its visible object children, directing them to draw themselves in the proper place. For the visible object to draw itself, it must handle <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>

Every visible object knows exactly where in the application's document it sits and exactly how big it is. It can easily change its own bounds, either moving itself in the document space or resizing itself.</LI>
<LI>
Ability to Draw Themselves<BR>
Every visible object is responsible for drawing itself. When it receives a drawing message (<CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
), it must recognize the context of the message and draw itself appropriately. <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 does not have a default handler for <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
; each subclass must handle this message itself.</LI>
<LI>
Input Handling<BR>
Pointer and click events as well as keyboard input can be automatically transmitted through the view to the VisContent if desired. Several combinations of event pass-throughs are available. When the VisContent receives a mouse event, it can intercept and handle it or pass it on to whatever object is under the pointer. If the VisContent does not handle the event (such as <CODE>
MSG_META_PTR</CODE>
) explicitly, the message will automatically be passed on to the object under the pointer.</LI>
<LI>
Geometry Management<BR>
Both the view and the VisContent can interact to provide specific sizing behavior for the window and content. Additional geometry management is available to help a VisComp composite object manage its children.</LI>
<LI>
Object Tree Management<BR>
Messages may easily be passed to an object's parent or children. Also, objects may be added to or removed from the visible tree without difficulty.</LI>
<LI>
Use of VisMonikers<BR>
In addition to simply drawing itself, a visible object can have a visible moniker that it can draw as well. This simplifies drawing text or handling <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
 in that the moniker can be set beforehand and simply drawn with a single call.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Using visible objects allows an application a lot more flexibility in display and input handling than is available with the generic objects. It also requires more programming; however much of the most difficult work is made easy by the view and VisContent objects. The application does not have to worry about clipping or scrolling or even determining what type of input event is taking place. All this is somewhat automatic and can, for the most part, be ignored.</P>

The Vis Class Tree</H3>
<P>
There are four base visible classes on which the other object libraries are founded. <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 is the most basic and at the root of the visible class tree. Under it are <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 and <CODE>
VisTextClass</CODE>
. <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
 is a subclass of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
<CODE>
VisTextClass</CODE>
 is special in that it is rarely subclassed as it already contains nearly all the functionality an application will need from a visible text object.</P>
<P>
The other three classes are typically subclassed by applications. None of the three can draw itself; instead, the subclass must handle <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
, the message that indicates the object must draw itself. The three different classes are used as follows:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
<CODE>
VisClass<BR>
VisClass</CODE>
<A NAME="UIOverview_a.htm_IX_VisClass:overview">
 </A>
 is the head of the visible class tree and therefore is the most broad-based in functionality. <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 objects can not have children and therefore can only exist as the leaves of the object tree.</LI>
<LI>
<CODE>
VisCompClass<BR>
VisCompClass</CODE>
<A NAME="UIOverview_a.htm_IX_VisCompClass:overview">
 </A>
 provides a composite <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 object. Essentially, this class is the same as <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 except that it can have children. It also includes several special geometry options that allow it to manage and place its children as well as set their bounds.</LI>
<LI>
<CODE>
VisContentClass<BR>
VisContentClass</CODE>
 is used only as the content of a GenView. It is a subclass of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 and therefore can have children and manage them with the same geometry features available to VisComp. In addition, the VisContent interacts with the GenView to handle input and drawing. The content can interact with the view to determine sizing behavior as well as input behavior.</LI>

<A HREF="#index.htm">UI Overview</A>: 4.5 <A HREF="#UIOverview_6.htm">Using the Visible Classes</A>: 
Creating a Visible Object Tree</H3>
<P>
You can create a visible object tree either in your Goc source code or at run-time. As stated earlier, the visible tree is linked to the generic UI object tree through the GenView object. Without a view object, you will not be able to display your visible objects.</P>
<P>
The visible object tree must have a <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
 object (or a subclass of <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
) as its root object. If another class is chosen for the topmost object, that class will have to handle all the messages that would normally be received by a content; otherwise, results are unpredictable and your application will likely not function the way you expect.</P>
<P>
VisContent objects are rarely, if ever, used lower in the visible tree than as the top node. For levels further down in the tree, you can use <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 (or, again, a subclass of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
). VisComp allows the object to have children and does not incur the same amount of overhead associated with a VisContent. Any object in the visible tree that may have children must be a &quot;composite&quot; object, or a subclass of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
Leaf nodes of the visible tree can be direct subclasses of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
. Objects of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 can not have children, but they have all the attributes and instance data you need for a leaf node. You must subclass <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
, however, if your object is ever to be shown on the screen: Since visible objects can have any application-defined visible representation, you must write the <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
 handler yourself; this can be done only in a subclass.</P>

<A HREF="#index.htm">UI Overview</A>: 4.6 <A HREF="#UIOverview_6.htm">Using the Visible Classes</A>: 
Working with Visible Object Trees</H3>
<P>
Working with visible object trees is quite easy and provides immense flexibility to your applications. Entire groups of objects can be added to, removed from, or moved around in the display with a single command. New objects can be created during execution, and others can be destroyed at will.</P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Sending Messages in the Tree</H4>
<P>
Often, an object in the visible tree will need to contact its parent or its children. For example, a child that needs to know the state of its parent must be able to find and contact that parent. Likewise, a parent that must notify all its children to redraw themselves must be able to quickly send out the notification.</P>
<P>
An object can send a message to its parent by simply specifying <CODE>
@visParent </CODE>
as the message recipient. That same object could also contact all its children by specifying the recipient as <CODE>
@visChildren</CODE>
. The message sent (only with <CODE>
@send</CODE>
 since there are multiple destinations) will go to each of the object's children.</P>
<P>
If you need more complicated message passing, you can build this into your Vis subclasses. It is not difficult for an object to retrieve the optr of any of its children or of its parent; it can then send the message appropriately. Each recipient can handle it in the same manner, forwarding it on to the next layer of the tree.</P>
<P>
<CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
<A NAME="UIOverview_c.htm_IX_Visual upward queries">
 </A>
 also employs several messages known as &quot;visual upward queries,&quot; or &quot;VUP&quot; messages. These travel up the visible tree until they encounter an object of the proper class, where they will be handled.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Altering the Tree</H4>
<P>
<CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 and <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 can handle messages that retrieve various information about the visible tree. They also have messages for altering the visible tree's structure.</P>

What TicTac Illustrates</H3>
<P>
The TicTac sample application can teach you several things about how the visible world works and about how to manage visible objects in an application. It is simple but illustrates the following concepts:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Drawing Visible Objects<BR>
Every visible object must be able to draw itself. <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 does not have any inherent code to make visible objects visible; instead, subclasses of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 must handle <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
.</LI>
<LI>
Changing an Object's Position<BR>
The pieces of the TicTac game allow the user to move them around the screen using the mouse. This entails tracking the mouse and then changing the object's position in the document.</LI>
<LI>
Sending Messages Up and Down the Visible Tree<BR>
The pieces must interact with the VisContent object to ensure they stay on the game board, and the VisContent must notify the pieces when the &quot;New Game&quot; button has been pressed. Therefore, messages must be passed both up and down the visible tree.</LI>
<LI>
Handling Input Events<BR>
In order for the user to move the pieces around the board, the pieces must be able to receive mouse events. Several different types of mouse events are handled to show the pieces moving around the board and to handle input properly.</LI>
<LI>
Drawing Background Graphics<BR>
Because the game board does not change at all, its background is drawn by the content object. The content could change its drawing behavior if necessary, but background graphics are most easily drawn by the content.</LI>
<LI>
Visible Tree Structure<BR>
A simple, two-layer visible tree is used in the TicTac application: The VisContent is the root of the tree, and each of the pieces is a leaf.</LI>
</UL>

<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">UI Overview</A>: 5.2 <A HREF="#UIOverview_d.htm">A UI Example</A>: 
What TicTac Does</H3>
<P>
The TicTac sample application is extremely simple. It draws a Tic Tac Toe board and its outline, and it has ten pieces which the user can move. Five of these pieces are gray squares, and five are gray circles. Each of the pieces may be moved by clicking and dragging it with the mouse. Any piece may be moved anywhere on the board, but pieces may not be moved off the board.</P>
<P>
A Game menu with a &quot;New Game&quot; trigger replaces all the pieces to their original locations. Because this is a simple example, no actual rules of any kind are enforced. Recognition of winning sequences and rules involving turn sequencing or playing against the computer are left as exercises for the reader.</P>

<A HREF="#index.htm">UI Overview</A>: 5.3 <A HREF="#UIOverview_d.htm">A UI Example</A>: 
The Structure of TicTac</H3>
<P>
The TicTac sample application is coded in two files: The first, <STRONG CLASS="fileName">
tictac.gp</STRONG>
, is the geode parameters file. The other, <STRONG CLASS="fileName">
tictac.goc</STRONG>
, contains all the code for objects in the application. The geode parameters file is similar to other <STRONG CLASS="fileName">
.gp</STRONG>
 files and is not discussed in this section.</P>
<P>
The application uses two different object trees, one for its generic UI and one for the game board and game pieces. The first consists of generic UI objects and the second of objects subclassed off <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 and <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
. The two object trees are diagrammed and described below.</P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
TicTac's Generic Tree</H4>
<P>
The TicTac application begins with two standard generic objects common to all applications: GenApplication and GenPrimary.

All eleven of the visible objects remain on the screen and in the view during their entire existence.

<P>
The TicTacBoard object draws the border around the board and makes sure the view window sizes itself to the same size as the board. The board is 180 points (2.5 inches) in height and 270 points (3.75 inches) in width; these numbers are stored as the constants BOARD_HEIGHT and BOARD_WIDTH. TicTacBoard also draws the playing field--this consists of the four white lines on the left side of the game board. TicTacBoard's other main function is to ensure that all the children (game pieces) behave properly; it makes sure the child's bounds are on the game board when the piece is moved, and it notifies the game pieces when they must draw themselves due to a view exposure. Finally, TicTacBoard receives the &quot;New Game&quot; message from the Game menu; it then redraws the game board and notifies each of the game pieces that they should return to their initial locations.</P>
<P>
Each of the game piece objects knows about its location and status. Each piece knows its initial location, current location, and proposed location (during a move). Every game piece is an instance of <CODE>

<A HREF="#index.htm">UI Overview</A>: 5.5 <A HREF="#UIOverview_d.htm">A UI Example</A>: 
TicTacPiece Specifics</H3>
<P>
<CODE>
TicTacPieceClass</CODE>
 contains most of the game's functionality. Since the user interacts directly with each game piece, the piece must know not only how to draw itself but also how to react to user input.</P>
<DL>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_PIECE_NEW_GAME</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This is the only message generated by the game itself that a game piece receives; it is sent by the TicTacBoard object when the user has pressed the New Game trigger. The game piece object responds by resetting its bounds to the original settings. It does not have to redraw or invalidate its old bounds because the TicTacBoard object will send a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
 later and will invalidate the entire board.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message notifies the object that it must draw itself and any accompanying graphics. The game piece responds by drawing the proper shape in the proper color in the proper place. Since every <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 object inherently knows its location and bounds, the object already knows where and how big the shape should appear. Whether a gray box or circle is drawn depends on the <CODE>
TTP_pieceType</CODE>
 instance data field.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_META_START_SELECT</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message is sent by the system when the user clicks a mouse button. The UI sends the message to whatever object lies under the pointer. The UI objects then pass the message down the object tree until it gets handled. The progression sends the message to TicTacApp, which passes it to TicTacPrimary, which passes it to TicTacView, which passes it to TicTacBoard, which (by letting the default <CODE>
VisContentClass</CODE>
 method handle it) passes it to the proper game piece object (if any) under the pointer. The game piece responds by grabbing the mouse and all subsequent pointer events.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_META_DRAG_SELECT</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message, like <CODE>
MSG_META_START_SELECT</CODE>
, indicates that the user has clicked a mouse button and has initiated a drag event. (Normally, this is used to select ranges or groups of objects; in TicTac, however, it is treated like <CODE>
MSG_META_START_SELECT</CODE>
.)</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_META_DRAG</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message is sent after the user has clicked the mouse button and is now moving the mouse pointer (and has not released the button yet). </DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_META_PTR</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message is sent when the pointer image is over the bounds of the game piece whether or not a mouse button has been pressed. (After the object has grabbed the mouse events by handling <CODE>
MSG_META_START_SELECT</CODE>
, the pointer event is sent whenever the mouse pointer is moved.) The piece determines whether or not it is being dragged around the screen. This is known as a &quot;drag event,&quot; and the game piece responds by drawing a piece-shaped outline around the mouse pointer. This outline will follow the pointer around the screen until the user releases the mouse button (causing a <CODE>
MSG_META_END_SELECT</CODE>
, below). The outline is first drawn in either the <CODE>
MSG_META_START_SELECT</CODE>
 or <CODE>
MSG_META_DRAG_SELECT</CODE>
 handler (whichever is called to start the drag event). <CODE>
MSG_META_PTR</CODE>
 and <CODE>
MSG_META_END_SELECT</CODE>
 erase the outline before drawing a new one. The game piece will maintain three locations in its instance data: Its <CODE>
VI_bounds</CODE>
 field maintains its position when selected. Its <CODE>
TTP_orig(horiz/vert)Pos</CODE>
 fields maintain its original position when the game was first started. Its <CODE>
TTP_(horiz/vert)Pos</CODE>
 fields maintain the current position of the outline and where the object would relocate to if the move was ended now. If the event is not a drag, the object will not react because it is assumed that no mouse button has been pressed and therefore the user is taking no action. 
<IMG SRC="UIOverview_12_selectPiece.gif">

</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_META_END_SELECT</DT><DD>
</CODE>
This message is sent when the user releases a pressed mouse button, ending the select-and-drag process. The game piece reacts by checking if the location of the pointer is a legal position on the game board. (It does this by sending a verification message to the TicTacBoard object to make sure the proposed new bounds are on the game board.) If the position is legal, the game piece moves itself there, erasing any leftover outlines (from the drag sequence) and its original image on the board. It then causes itself to draw in the new location by sending itself a <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
. If the new location is not legally on the game board, then the object will reset all its instance data and erase any leftover outlines, causing it to revert to its location before the select-and-drag sequence began.</DD>
