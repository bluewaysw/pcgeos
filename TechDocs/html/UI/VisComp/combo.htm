VisCompClass Features</H2>
<P>
Composite visible objects provide several features and functions that normal visible objects can not. <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 has several instance data fields above and beyond those found in <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 (since <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 is a subclass of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
, it inherits all its instance data and methods). Although it only handles a few messages not defined in <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
, it provides much more functionality. Some of the main features of composite objects are listed below:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
They can have children.<BR>
Normal visible objects can exist only as leaves of a visible object tree. <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 can have children, allowing the tree to be built to any number of levels. See <A HREF="../../UI/VisClass/VisClass_10.htm#50052">the VisClass chapter</A>for full information on visible trees.</LI>
<LI>
They can manage their children's geometry.<BR>
A composite's children can be managed arbitrarily by the composite, or the composite can use the geometry manager to automatically position and size its children. Since a composite can have other composites as its children, this sizing can descend recursively throughout the visible tree, making the entire tree's geometry completely self-managed. See <A HREF="#VisComp_a.htm_13351"> Managing Geometry</A>
 for information on geometry management.</LI>
<LI>
They can create and manage their own windows.<BR>
Composite objects can create their own graphics windows. Though this is not typically done (except in Specific UI libraries), it is possible. See <A HREF="#VisComp_b.htm_13783"> Managing Graphic Windows</A>
 for more information on windows.</LI>
<LI>
They support other <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 functions.<BR>
<CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 inherits all the instance data fields and messages of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
. As such, it can do everything normal <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 objects can do. See <A HREF="../../UI/VisClass/index.htm">the VisClass chapter</A>for full information on <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
.</LI>

VisCompClass Instance Data</H2>
<P>
As stated above, <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 inherits all the instance data fields from <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
. All of those fields may be set and reset as they could be for an object of that class. Composite objects also have four other instance fields, shown in <A HREF="#VisComp_2.htm_37927"> VisCompClass Instance Fields</A>

 </A>
Normal visible objects have just one instance field for tree construction: the <CODE>
VI_link</CODE>
 field that points to the object's next sibling. For an object to have children, it must also have an instance field declared with the keyword <CODE>
@composite</CODE>
; this field, in <CODE>

, is <CODE>
VCI_comp</CODE>

VCI_gadgetExcl</H3>
<P>
Since the composite object must manage several other objects, it must also keep track of certain hierarchies used by the UI; the gadget exclusive is one of these. Within each branch of the visible object tree, only one visible object may have the gadget exclusive at a time. The gadget exclusive is kept track of via a path of pointers from the top of the tree down to the object having the exclusive.</P>

 </A>
The <CODE>
VCI_gadgetExcl</CODE>
 field determines which child of the composite has the gadget exclusive. The child indicated in this field may or may not actually have the gadget exclusive for the entire visible tree; if the branch does not have the exclusive, neither will the child object. The gadget exclusive is similar to the other hierarchies of the input manager and acts the same way.</P>
<P>
Applications never access the <CODE>
VCI_gadgetExcl</CODE>

<DL>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_TAKE_GADGET_EXCL</DT><DD>

 field appropriately.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MSG_VIS_RELEASE_GADGET_EXCL</DT><DD>

VCI_window</H3>
<P>
Every visible object has a window associated with it in which it will be drawn. Normal <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 objects have no control over what window they're associated with; they must be in the same window as their composite parents. Composites may need to appear in different windows from their parents, however.<A NAME="VisComp_5.htm_IX_VCI_window">
 </A>
 Thus, <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 has the <CODE>
VCI_window</CODE>
 field, which contains the window handle of the window in which the composite's branch will be drawn.</P>
<P>
Applications will not access this field directly. Typically, composites will be drawn in the window associated with their parent composites or contents. Sometimes, however, an application will want a visible branch to appear in a window different from that of the rest of the visible tree. The composite then must use other <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 messages for creating and associating a window. This process is discussed in more detail in <A HREF="#VisComp_b.htm_13783"> Managing Graphic Windows</A>

VCI_geoAttrs</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="VisComp_6.htm_IX_Geometry:object flags">

The most-used feature of composite objects is their ability to manage the sizing and placement of their children. This is known as managing the composite's geometry.</P>

<A NAME="VisComp_6.htm_IX_VisCompGeoAttrs">
 </A>
<A NAME="VisComp_6.htm_IX_VCI_geoAttrs">
 </A>
The geometry management behavior implemented by a particular composite object is determined by its <CODE>
VCI_geoAttrs</CODE>
 and <CODE>
VCI_geoDimensionAttrs</CODE>
 fields. Both of these fields may be set and altered by applications as their geometry needs change. The <CODE>
VCI_geoAttrs</CODE>
 field, specifically, determines the type of geometry management employed by the composite.</P>
<P>
The <CODE>
VCI_geoAttrs</CODE>
 field may contain any or all of the following eight flags:</P>
<DL>
<DT>
VCGA_ORIENT_CHILDREN_VERTICALLY</DT><DD>
<A NAME="VisComp_6.htm_IX_VCGA_&ldots;">
 </A>
This flag indicates that the composite's children should be arranged vertically rather than the default (horizontally).</DD>
<DT>
VCGA_INCLUDE_ENDS_IN_CHILD_SPACING</DT><DD>
When the composite is using full justification (see <CODE>
VCI_geoDimensionAttrs</CODE>
), this flag indicates that there should be as much space before the first child and after the last child as there is between the children. If this flag is not set, there will be no space outside the first and last children.</DD>
<DT>
VCGA_ALLOW_CHILDREN_TO_WRAP</DT><DD>
This flag will allow the children to wrap if their combined lengths won't allow them to fit within the composite's bounds. The composite will keep within the bounds of its parent, and its children will wrap as necessary. If this flag is not set, the composite will try to grow to be as large as necessary to fit all children.</DD>
<DT>
VCGA_ONE_PASS_OPTIMIZATION</DT><DD>
This flag makes the geometry manager make only one pass at managing the children. It should only be set if the children can be guaranteed not to wrap or resize.</DD>
<DT>
VCGA_CUSTOM_MANAGE_CHILDREN</DT><DD>
This flag indicates that the composite will manage its children without using the geometry manager. This allows the composite or its children to manually determine their positions and sizes. If this flag is set, the composite will keep its own bounds in its <CODE>
VI_bounds</CODE>
 field, just as other Vis objects. This flag in a composite indicates custom management for the composite's entire branch, not just its children.</DD>
<DT>
VCGA_HAS_MINIMUM_SIZE</DT><DD>
This flag indicates that the composite has a minimum size. The geometry manager will query the composite for this minimum and will ensure the object never gets smaller than that regardless of the size of its children. The minimum size must be returned by a custom <CODE>
MSG_VIS_COMP_GET_MINIMUM_SIZE</CODE>
 handler.</DD>
<DT>
VCGA_WRAP_AFTER_CHILD_COUNT</DT><DD>
Used in conjunction with VCGA_ALLOW_CHILDREN_TO_WRAP, this flag will cause child wrapping after a certain number of children. This can cause wrapping based on the number of children rather than on child size. The geometry manager will query the composite with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_COMP_GET_WRAP_COUNT</CODE>
.</DD>
<DT>
VCGA_ONLY_DRAWS_IN_MARGINS</DT><DD>
This flag is used for optimized visual updates. It causes only the margins of the composite to be drawn when its image is marked invalid; all children of the composite must have their own images marked invalid if they are to be redrawn as well.</DD>

<P>
With the exception of the geometry flags mentioned above and the management of children, the use of <CODE>

; for example, nearly all geometry management and object tree management messages are defined in <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
. Some reminders are listed below, however.</P>
<P>
Not all composite objects will have something to draw. Some composites will be used simply as grouping objects to manage visible children. In these cases, you will not have to subclass <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 but can instead use the class directly.</P>
<P>
Many composite objects will have something to draw, though. For example, a composite may want to draw a box around its children or wash a different background color behind them. If this is the case, the object must be a subclass of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 and must handle <CODE>
MSG_VIS_DRAW</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
One of the primary functions of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 is to pass input events and other messages down and up the tree to the proper objects. This is done automatically. You can, however, change this behavior by subclassing <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 and intercepting the messages in which the object will be interested.</P>

A special feature of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
, and one that can be used in many ways, is its ability to automatically manage its children. By setting various flags in the composite's instance fields, you can have it control its children's sizing and position without additional code in your application.</P>
<P>
Most of the flags you can set in <CODE>
VCI_geoAttrs</CODE>
 and <CODE>
VCI_geoDimensionAttrs</CODE>
 are explained fully in <A HREF="#VisComp_2.htm_55772"> VisCompClass Instance Data</A>
. You should especially be aware that if you do not want to use the geometry management capabilities of <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
, you should set VCGA_CUSTOM_MANAGE_CHILDREN in <CODE>
VCI_geoAttrs</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
In addition to the messages provided in <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 for geometry management, <CODE>
VisCompClass</CODE>
 has four that return information about its current geometry. These are necessary because composites may be children of other composites, and therefore they may be managed. These messages are detailed below.</P>
<P>
Most of the issues of geometry management are discussed in <A HREF="#UI/VisClass/VisClass_e.htm">the VisClass chapter</A>.</P>

It is very rare that a visible object will want to create its own window without using a generic object. This practice is highly discouraged as well because it will almost certainly violate some principles of most specific UI specifications. You can, however, set up a visible object to have its own window with the following steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
Set up the VisComp object as a window group.<BR>
Either instantiate a new VisComp object or set it up and load it in, off-screen. Then set the flags VTF_IS_WINDOW and VTF_IS_WIN_GROUP in the composite to make it a window and the top of the visible tree.</LI>
<LI>
Add visible children to the window object.<BR>
Using <CODE>
MSG_VIS_ADD_CHILD</CODE>
, add any visible object children to the window group as you need. If some of the children had possibly been removed from the visible tree earlier, you may have to mark them invalid.</LI>
<LI>
Add your window to the field window.<BR>
Determine the handle of the parent window you need, then set your window group object as a child of the parent.</LI>
<LI>
Set the top object in your window group visible.<BR>
Set VA_VISIBLE using <CODE>
MSG_VIS_SET_ATTR</CODE>
 to mark the window group visible. The window will be opened, and it will receive a <CODE>
MSG_META_EXPOSED</CODE>
 indicating that it and all its children should draw themselves.<A NAME="VisComp_b.htm_marker=7604">
