The GenFileSelector provides the user interface and functionality to allow a user to traverse directories and volumes (disks) and view the files contained therein. It can be customized to limit the displayed file names or to expand the listings to include special files.</P>

This object is used by the GenDocumentControl object to provide most file dialog boxes. If your application uses the Document Control objects, you will probably not need to add a GenFileSelector.</P>

File Selector Overview</H2>
<P>
When you are not using the Document Control objects but need to allow the user to traverse directories and disks in order to locate a given file, you should use a GenFileSelector. The File Selector is designed to give tremendous flexibility for many different types of file searches, providing both directory scanning and user interface. An OSF/Motif File Selector is shown below.</P>
<P>
The File Selector allows users to browse all the directories and disks readable by DOS, including readable network drives. This browsing is completely internal to the File Selector; until the user selects a file from the list, your application does not need to know what the File Selector is doing.</P>
<P>
You can customize the searches the File Selector makes in several different ways:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Setting paths, volumes, and selections<BR>
You may direct the File Selector to show any given directory on any given volume, and you may also set the selected file displayed. Additionally, you can navigate directories with messages sent to the File Selector. See <A HREF="#FileSelectors_13.htm_20958"> The Current Selection</A>
.</LI>
<LI>
Limiting a directory scan to certain files<BR>
The File Selector can limit its directory scans to show only the files you request. You may limit the scan based on file types, file attributes, or filename extensions. See <A HREF="#FileSelectors_7.htm_50084"> File Selector Instance Data</A>
.</LI>
<LI>
Searching for associated files<BR>
You can limit the File Selector's searches to only those files that match a given creator or token. That is, the File Selector will display only files created by a particular geode. See <A HREF="#FileSelectors_a.htm_53091"> Matching a File's Token</A>
.</LI>
<LI>
Customizing the searches<BR>
If the available search options don't fit your needs, you can create a customized search. If this type of search is employed, the File Selector will send a special message to itself--to take advantage of this, you can easily subclass the GenFileSelector and write a custom handler for this special message. See <A HREF="#FileSelectors_f.htm_27532"> Searching Via Callback Routine</A>
.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
All of the directory scanning and path navigation is internal to the GenFileSelector. When a selection is made (a user single- or double-clicks on an entry, for example), the File Selector will send out a message indicating the selection. You can, however, force the File Selector to change to any directory or search criteria at any time.

File Selector Basics</H2>
<P>
The following sections describe how to set up and use the File Selector in a simple configuration and how to modify the configuration for common uses.</P>
<P>
Most File Selectors will be put in dialog boxes and will be accompanied by at the least a Reply Bar. (For more information on dialog boxes and reply bars, see <A HREF="../../UI/GenInteraction/index.htm">the Menus and Dialog Boxes chapter</A>.) Typically, the dialog box will be brought up by a menu item such as <EM>Open...</EM>
 or <EM>
Insert From Text File...</EM>
.
<IMG SRC="FileSelectors_2_dump.gif">

</P>
<P>
The figure above shows a sample <EM>
Insert From Text File</EM>
 dialog box. (Note that you would probably use the Impex object for this functionality; this is provided for example.) This box has three basic elements: The GenGlyphDisplay (the title at the top), the File Selector (the scrolling list of files and the disk and folder icons), and the Reply Bar. In nearly all cases, these three elements will be included with every File Selector in its dialog box.</P>

<P>
For a typical configuration, you will have to set up a GenInteraction as a dialog box. (For information dialog boxes, see <A HREF="../../UI/GenInteraction/index.htm">the Menus and Dialog Boxes chapter</A>.) The File Selector and other elements of the dialog should be placed as children of the Interaction.</P><P>

 shows the Goc code required to display and use a File Selector in this basic form. You can use this code to create a similar dialog box with the proper elements or modify it to gain the functionality you want. Specific permutations of this configuration will be described in <A HREF="#FileSelectors_6.htm_16485"> Some Common Customizations</A>
; however, the remainder of this section describes the basics of the File Selector.</P>

<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">The FileSelector Object</A>: 2.2 <A HREF="#FileSelectors_2.htm">File Selector Basics</A>: 
Supporting the File Selector</H3>
<P>
To use the File Selector as shown in <A HREF="#FileSelectors_3.htm_24357"> A Basic File Selector</A>
, your application must have some object (which may be the Process object) that can handle all the cases that may arise from a user's interaction with the dialog box. All of these cases are listed below:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The user clicks once on an entry in the File Selector's list.<BR>
When this happens, the File Selector highlights the selected entry and sends its notification message to its destination object. With the message will come a record of flags indicating the action was a single click.</LI>
<LI>
The user double-clicks on an entry in the File Selector's list.<BR>
This action causes the File Selector to send its notification message to its destination object. The default action for the dialog box containing the File Selector will also occur (e.g. the default action is what happens when the &quot;Insert&quot; trigger is pressed). If the current selection is a directory, the application does not need to do anything; the File Selector will open the directory automatically. If the current selection is a file, the application must deal with the file properly and then close the dialog box containing the File Selector.</LI>
<LI>
The user clicks on the &quot;Insert&quot; trigger.<BR>
This action causes the trigger to send its notification message to its destination object. In most cases, the trigger with be an IC_OK trigger that will cause the File Selector to act as if a double-click had occurred. If the current selected entry in the list is a directory, the application should instruct the File Selector to open the directory and display its file list. If the current selection is a file, the application is responsible for dealing properly with the file; additionally, the application should then close the dialog box containing the File Selector.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The above list describes the basics of File Selector support. Different File Selectors (such as SaveAs dialogs that allow the user to type in a file name) can easily be defined by adding other gadgetry to the controller. All other actions possible are internal to the file selector (e.g. the &quot;Go To Document&quot; button is a feature of the File Selector which is invisible to the application).</P>

<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">The FileSelector Object</A>: 2.3 <A HREF="#FileSelectors_2.htm">File Selector Basics</A>: 
Messages to Handle</H3>
<P>
The list above shows two different messages that your File Selector's basic configuration: The first results from the user clicking on an entry and comes from the File Selector object, and the second is sent by the &quot;Insert&quot; trigger when the user clicks on it. The following descriptions show what you must do when handling these messages. (Note that in many cases only one message, the File Selector's action message, will be used; this occurs when the &quot;Insert&quot; trigger is actually an IC_OK or similar response trigger.)</P>
<P>
<A HREF="#FileSelectors_5.htm_21264"> Handling a File Selector Selection</A>
 shows a sample handler for the message sent by the File Selector. <A HREF="#FileSelectors_5.htm_43812"> Handling a File Selector "OK" Button</A>
 shows a sample handler for the message sent by the Reply Bar's Insert trigger. Both these handlers are written to go with the code in <A HREF="#FileSelectors_3.htm_24357"> A Basic File Selector</A>
, and both handle the simplest case. Where application-specific code is required, comments have been inserted. </P>
<P>
You should not, in general, <EM>
have</EM>
 to handle any more than the File Selector's notification message. You may add your own gadgetry to add other functionality, however.</P>
<P>
The File Selector's notification message is the message you set in <CODE>
GFSI_notificationMsg</CODE>
. This message should have the same definition as the prototype <CODE>
GEN_FILE_SELECTOR_NOTIFICATION_MSG</CODE>
, which is defined below. You can either define it with the same parameters, or you can define it exactly on the prototype. (The latter is recommended.) The prototype carries with the notification a word of <CODE>
GenFileSelectorEntryFlags</CODE>

<DL>
<DT>
GFSEF_TYPE</DT><DD>
This is a two-bit field (at offset GFSEF_TYPE_OFFSET) that describes the type of the selection. This may be one of GFSET_FILE (selection is a file), GFSET_SUBDIR (selection is a subdirectory), or GFSET_VOLUME (selection is a volume or disk). These are values of <CODE>
GenFileSelectorEntryType</CODE>

 </A>
Some Common Customizations</H3>
<P>
Although the basics are all covered under the previous sections and you need nothing more to add a File Selector to your application, you will probably want to customize it somewhat. Typical simple customizations include limiting the types of files displayed, restricting the search to a single directory or volume, limiting the display to directories only (no files), and limiting the search to only those files with a given filename extension.</P>
<P>
Each of these is shown in the displays following this section. Notice that the only changes you need to make to implement any of these customizations is to the File Selector's Goc code. You will not need to handle any other messages or add other code to your application. These customizations are shown in <A HREF="#FileSelectors_6.htm_16786"> Display Only Directories</A>
 through <A HREF="#FileSelectors_6.htm_68431"> Show Only Files with a Given Filename Extension</A>
 and show how to do the following (you may apply any combination):</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Show directories only.<BR>
The File Selector will display no files, only directories.</LI>
<LI>
Show all files in a single directory.<BR>
The File Selector will show all files but will restrict directory navigation; the user can only select files in the current directory.</LI>
<LI>
Show hidden files as well as normal files.</LI>
<LI>
Show all files created by a given geode.<BR>
The File Selector will restrict displayed files to only those that were created by the geode with the given <CODE>
tokenChars</CODE>
 and <CODE>
tokenID</CODE>
.</LI>
<LI>
Show all files with a given filename extension.<BR>
The File Selector will restrict the files displayed to only those with the given filename extension.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
These are not the only customizations you can make. Although they will satisfy the needs of the large majority of applications, you can change the File Selector's searches any way you want (you can even set up a callback routine to filter every single file or directory). The remainder of this chapter explains in detail the different things you can do to the File Selector.</P>

The File Selector is diverse and flexible, and you can customize it in many different ways.

The File Selector has a number of attributes and variable data fields that determine its functionality. These are listed in <A HREF="#FileSelectors_7.htm_54516"> File Selector Attributes</A>

By setting up a filename mask, you can limit the File Selector's displays to only those files that conform to the mask characters. For example, to show only those files with the .BAT extender, you could set the mask to<STRONG CLASS="fileName">

*.BAT.</P>
<P>
Only one mask may be in use at any given time. If you need to mask for two different sets of characters (e.g. *.BAT and *.EXE), you will need to subclass the File Selector and modify its behavior. (See <A HREF="#FileSelectors_f.htm_27532"> Searching Via Callback Routine</A>
 for more information.)</P>
<P>

FileLongName</CODE>

FileEnum()</CODE>
 routine detailed in <A HREF="../../Files/FileSys/FileSys_f.htm#51873">the File System chapter</A>. In short, the mask is taken as a character string matched to the entire file name (thus, a mask of <STRONG CLASS="fileName">*.*</CODE>
 implies all files with a period in their names; the period separating a filename and an extension will not count as a period).</P>
<P>
Normally, the mask is applied only to files and not to directories or volumes. However, if the <CODE>

Searching Via Callback Routine</H3>
<PRE>MSG_GEN_FILE_SELECTOR_GET_FILTER_ROUTINE, GenFileSelectorFilterRoutine</PRE>
<P>
If the built-in search limitations do not provide the functionality you require, you can set up a callback routine that the File Selector will call for each file or subdirectory in a directory scan. This routine will serve as the final filter for each file; if a file passes all other filters, it will be subjected to your routine. This procedure adds overhead to any scan, of course, so you should try to use the built-in File Selector functions whenever possible.</P>
<P>
To set the File Selector to use the callback functionality, you must set FSFC_FILTER_FILE in the <CODE>
GFSI_fileCriteria</CODE>
 field. If your callback routine is written in C, you must also set FSFC_FILTER_IS_C; the routine must also follow the Pascal calling convention.</P>
<P>
In order to take advantage of the callback functionality, you must first subclass <CODE>
GenFileSelectorClass</CODE>
 to handle the message <CODE>
MSG_GEN_FILE_SELECTOR_GET_FILTER_ROUTINE</CODE>
, which the File Selector will send to itself before beginning the directory scan. Your handler should return the address of the callback routine along with a pointer to an array of attributes that will be passed to it.</P>
<P>
The callback routine can assume that if it is being called, the file has passed all other filters--the callback is therefore the last word on acceptance or rejection of the file. In essence, the callback is asked whether the file should be rejected: It should return the constant TRUE if the file is to be rejected but FALSE if it is not to be rejected.</P>
<P>
As mentioned above, you can designate an array of extended file attributes that will be passed to the callback routine. This array contains a number of <CODE>
FileExtAttrDesc</CODE>
 structures, each of which defines a certain attribute and some extra data for the attribute. This structure is shown below:</P>
<PRE>typedef struct {
    FileExtendedAttribute FEAD_attr;
				/* file attribute to
				 * get or set */
    void		* FEAD_value;
				/* pointer to a buffer
				 * or new value */</PRE>
<PRE>    word		FEAD_size;		/* size of buffer or
				 * new value */
    char		* FEAD_name;
				/* if custom attribute,
				 * pointer to name */
} FileExtAttrDesc;</PRE>
<P>
In the above context, <CODE>
FEAD_value</CODE>
 is meaningless and <CODE>
FEAD_size</CODE>
 is the number of bytes required to hold the value of the attribute. Note that this array is not passed to the callback routine; instead, it specifies the structure and composition of the values that will be.</P>

<P>
When a user selects an entry in the File Selector's displayed list, either by double-clicking or by clicking on an &quot;Open&quot; button, the File Selector will notify a predetermined object or process that a selection has been made. In addition, if the selection is a volume or a directory, the File Selector will automatically (on a double-click) open the selection and show the new file list.</P>

<A NAME="FileSelectors_12.htm_IX_GFBI_destinationMsg">
 </A>
<A NAME="FileSelectors_12.htm_IX_GFBI_notificationMsg">
 </A>
When defining your GenFileSelector, you must designate an output object and a message that will be sent to it when the user makes a selection. The message is stored in the <CODE>
GFSI_notificationMsg</CODE>
 instance field, and the object's optr is stored in the <CODE>
GFSI_destination</CODE>
 instance field. Note that instead of an optr, you may use a <CODE>
TravelOption</CODE>
 as the output destination (TO_TARGET, TO_FOCUS, etc.); you can also use <CODE>
ATTR_GEN_DESTINATION_CLASS</CODE>
 to specify the class of the output object to ensure the notification message is only delivered to a class that can handle it.</P>
<P>
When the user makes a selection, the File Selector will send the notification message to the destination object along with flags indicating whether the selection was a single or double click. The message is defined by the class that will receive it; for example, the File Selector definition in <A HREF="#FileSelectors_3.htm_24357"> A Basic File Selector</A>
 designates <CODE>
MSG_MY_APP_FILE_SELECTED</CODE>
 as the notification message that will be sent to the application's process object (the destination object).</P>
<P>
You must set both the notification message and the destination object in your File Selector's Goc code. If you don't, no message will be sent, and your application will ignore user input to the File Selector. (The File Selector will still allow the user to navigate throughout the file system, and your application can query the File Selector as to its current selection, however.)</P>

<P>
The File Selector keeps track of which item is currently designated as the <EM>
selection</EM>
. The selection appears on the screen as the only highlighted entry in the current list (the highlighted entry may be scrolled out of the view but remains the selection). Additionally, the selection is the file or folder on which any operations (such as open) will be executed.</P>
<P>
The <CODE>
GFSI_selection</CODE>
 field of the GenFileSelector's instance data is a null-terminated character string representing the name of the selection. The format of the selection string depends on the context: If the File Selector is displaying the volume list and thus the selection is a volume label, the string will consist of a drive name followed by a colon. (For non-removable disks, the colon will be followed by [<CODE>
volume name</CODE>
].) If the File Selector is displaying a directory and the selection is a file or directory, the selection string will consist of the name of the file or directory selected. The selection does not contain any information about the current volume or directory.</P>
<P>
By sending the following messages, you can retrieve or set the current selection in your application. These messages affect <CODE>
ATTR_GEN_PATH_DATA,</CODE>
 managed by <CODE>

<P>
Each time the File Selector changes directories, it scans that directory and displays only the files it is supposed to.

Occasionally you will want to scan the current directory only once after changing many parameters instead of rescanning after each change (search limitations, current volume, current selection, etc.). To optimize redrawing and rescanning, you can temporarily keep the GenFileSelector from scanning each time a <CODE>
