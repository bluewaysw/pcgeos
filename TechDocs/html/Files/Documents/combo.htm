The GEOS document control objects let the programmer ignore most of the details of opening, closing, and saving files. The programmer just specifies the characteristics the application will expect of its documents. The document control presents all dialog boxes and notices to the user, and it maintains the &quot;Save,&quot; &quot;Save As,&quot; &quot;Open,&quot; &quot;New,&quot; and &quot;Revert&quot; triggers in the File menu.</P>
<P>
There are three parts to the document control: the GenDocumentControl object, which maintains the user interface; the GenDocuments, each of which manages a single document; and the GenDocumentGroup object, which creates and manages GenDocument objects as needed. These classes can all be subclassed to add functionality.</P>

Document Control Overview</H2>
<P>
A program that creates or uses files--in short, almost all applications--has to deal with many tasks. It has to present dialog boxes to the user so he can choose which file to open; it must give alert messages when the user tries to do something dangerous, like quit without saving; and it must notice when GEOS is being shut down and make sure it saves appropriate data.</P>
<P>
The document control objects make these tasks much easier. They take care of some of these tasks by themselves; for example, they maintain the File menu commands and display dialog and alert boxes as needed. The Document Control objects make other application jobs much easier by sending messages at appropriate times. They can also manage several documents at once, making it much easier for applications to manage multiple documents.</P>
<P>
Many different document control sample applications are provided with the SDK. In most cases, you should be able to get your document control by copying over code from the appropriate sample application, then customizing it.</P>

<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">Documents</A>: 1.1 <A HREF="#Documents_1.htm">Document Control Overview</A>: 
The Document Control Objects</H3>
<P>
There are three different classes of objects which together constitute the document control. These are <CODE>
GenDocumentControlClass</CODE>
, <CODE>
GenDocumentGroupClass</CODE>
, and <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
. A document will need at least one of each to use the document control technology. The relationship between the objects is diagramed below.
<IMG SRC="Documents_2_objTree.gif">

</P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenDocumentControlClass</H4>
<P>
An application will have one object of class <CODE>
GenDocumentControlClass</CODE>
. This object manages the user interface: It presents some dialog and alert boxes, it manages the File Selector, it creates appropriate entries for the File menu, and it updates the enabled/disabled states of these items (e.g. it disables the <EM>
Save</EM>
 trigger after the file has been saved).</P>
<P>
The GenDocumentControl is generally made a child of the file menu, which is itself a child (or descendant) of the GenPrimary. The GenDocumentControl is on the GenPrimary's active list. It has no children, but it does have an optr to the GenDocumentGroup object. By convention, the GenDocumentControl object is in the same data segment as the GenPrimary object. Certain attributes of the GenDocumentControl object will determine the characteristics of the File Selector and other UI gadgets.</P>
<P>
<CODE>
GenDocumentControlClass</CODE>
 is a subclass of <CODE>
GenControlClass</CODE>
. This means that you can set up toolboxes to perform the &quot;Save,&quot; &quot;Open,&quot; etc., actions. For more details, see <A HREF="../../SysObjects/Controllers/combo.htm">the Controllers chapter</A>.</P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenDocumentGroupClass</H4>
<P>
An application will have one object of class <CODE>
GenDocumentGroupClass</CODE>
. This object creates and manages the document objects. Ordinarily, the document objects belong to <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
. However, if the program wishes to alter the behavior of the document object, it can create a subclass of <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
. In this case, the GenDocumentGroup object will contain a pointer to the class definition of the document subclass, and will create document objects of this class as needed.</P>
<P>
The GenDocumentGroup object is a child of any object. It does not have any children when it is declared; however, it will dynamically give itself document-object children at run-time. It is in its own data segment. Certain of its attributes determine what the attributes of its document children will be.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
GenDocumentClass</H4>
<P>
Each GenDocument object manages a single open file. It keeps track of the volume, path, and filename for the document, the dirty state of the document, and other document-related information. It opens and closes files and presents file-related dialog boxes (e.g., &quot;Save changes before closing?&quot;). Programs often define a subclass of the <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
 which has additional, application-related functionality. In this case, objects of the subclass are used instead of objects of <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
.</P>
<P>
<CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
 is a subclass of <CODE>
GenContentClass</CODE>
. Therefore, document objects can receive the output of GenView objects. GenDocument objects have all the functionality of GenContent objects. GenContent objects are themselves subclassed from <CODE>
GenClass</CODE>
. Very few applications will use the GenContent objects directly; for that reason, they are documented in this chapter.</P>
<P>
Document objects are not declared in the source code; they are created at run-time by the GenDocumentGroup object. The document currently active is called the <EM>
target document</EM>
. </P>

<A HREF="#index.htm">Documents</A>: 1.2 <A HREF="#Documents_1.htm">Document Control Overview</A>: 
Document Control Interaction</H3>
<P>
A simple user operation will usually involve all three types of objects. For example, suppose the user selects the <EM>
Open</EM>
 trigger from the File menu. The following actions will be taken:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
The <EM>
Open</EM>
 trigger sends a <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_CONTROL_INITIATE_OPEN_DOC</CODE>
 to the GenDocumentControl object. The GenDocumentControl object responds by displaying a file selector.</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
When the user selects a file and clicks &quot;OK,&quot; the GenDocumentControl object gets the selected file's path from the file selector object.</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
The GenDocumentControl object sends a <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_GROUP_OPEN_DOC</CODE>
 to the GenDocumentGroup, passing the name and path of the file to open.</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
The GenDocumentGroup creates a document object, either of class <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
 or of a programmer-specified class. The GenDocumentGroup object sends a <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_OPEN</CODE>
 to the document object, passing the file and path name to be opened.</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
The document object opens the file specified and handles errors appropriately. It then sends messages to the application instructing it to create the UI and initialize the file.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
Most of these steps are transparent to the application programmer. Typically, an application will intercept <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_INITIALIZE_DOCUMENT_FILE</CODE>
; the programmer needs only to write this handler, not all the code needed for the above steps.</P>

Document Control Models</H3>
<P>
GEOS allows two distinct models of document control, a <EM>
Procedural</EM>
 model and an <EM>
Object</EM>
 model. While the two models use the same objects, they embody different programming philosophies.</P>
<P>
The <EM>
Procedural</EM>
 model of document control is much like traditional, non-object-oriented programming. Under this model, whenever a situation arises that needs the application's attention, the document control objects will send a message to a single object (generally the Process object). This object handles all of these situations.</P>
<P>
Under the <EM>
Object</EM>
 model of document control, the application defines a subclass of <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
. This new document class has methods to handle situations needing the application's attention. This model is based on the philosophy of object-oriented programming; each document object has code to handle situations arising for that document.</P>
<P>
The main difference between the two models is where the messages are sent. Under the Procedural model, messages are sent to the Process object; under the Object model, messages are sent to the appropriate document object. Every message sent in the Procedural model corresponds to a message sent in the Object model.</P>
<P>
The Procedural model is simpler to use; it does not require the application to subclass objects. It is thus well-suited for simple applications which will have only one file open at a time. It may also be an easier model for programmers who are new to object-oriented programming. The Object model, on the other hand, is best suited for applications which will have many documents open at once; the application can let every document object manage a single document without worrying about other open documents.</P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
The Procedural Model</H4>
<P>
The <EM>
Procedural</EM>
 model of document control is much like traditional, procedure-oriented programming. This model is simpler to implement than the object-model. It is well suited for simple applications which have only one document open at a time.

</P>
<P>
Under the Procedural model of document control, every time a situation arises which requires the application's attention, the document control objects will send an appropriate message to the GenDocumentGroup object's output. These messages are imported from <CODE>
MetaClass</CODE>
, so all objects can handle them. The application will generally use global variables for run-time data storage.</P>
<P>
For example, when a new document needs to be initialized, the<CODE>
 </CODE>
document control sends a <CODE>
MSG_META_DOC_OUTPUT_INITIALIZE_DOCUMENT_FILE</CODE>
 to its output object. The output object takes any appropriate steps (e.g., storing the file handle, setting up the map block, etc.).</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
The Object Model</H4>
<P>
The <EM>
Object</EM>
 model of document control is better suited to advanced applications and applications which will have more than one document open at a time. Under this model, the application defines a subclass of <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
. This new document class has handlers for situations requiring the application's attention. It also has local variables (i.e., instance data fields) which store any information the application will need about this document. </P>
<P>
Whenever a situation arises that needs the application's attention, the relevant document object will send a message to itself. This document object will then handle the message. For example, an application might define its own document class, <CODE>
MyAppDocumentClass</CODE>
 (a subclass of <CODE>
GenDocumentClass)</CODE>
. Suppose a new document has been created and needs to be initialized. First, the GenDocumentGroup object will create a new document object by instantiating an object of <CODE>
MyAppDocumentClass</CODE>
. Next, the new document object will send itself a <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_INITIALIZE_DOCUMENT_FILE. </CODE>
<CODE>
MyAppDocumentClass</CODE>
 will have a handler for this message; the handler will initialize the file as well as the document object's data structures.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Messages Under the Two Models</H4>
<P>
The simplest way to show the difference between the two models is to see how a single event is handled. This section examines one specific case, in which a document needs to be initialized; other cases are handled analogously.</P>
<P>
Suppose a situation arises needing the application's attention; for example, a document is created and needs to be initialized. First, the document object will send an appropriate message to itself. In this case, it would send itself the message <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_INITIALIZE_DOCUMENT_FILE</CODE>
. If the application uses a subclass of <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
 and this subclass has a handler for <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_INITIALIZE_DOCUMENT_FILE</CODE>
, the messager will call that method; otherwise, the messager will call the handler defined for this message by <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
. The handler in <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
 will find out the <CODE>
GenDocumentGroup</CODE>
 object's output optr. If this optr is non-null, the handler will send an appropriate message (in this case, <CODE>
MSG_META_DOC_OUTPUT_INITIALIZE_DOCUMENT_FILE</CODE>
) to the output object.</P>
<P>
Note that, under normal circumstances, the application will handle only one of the two messages. For example, if the application writes a handler for <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_PHYSICAL_SAVE</CODE>
, the handler defined by <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
 will not be called; as a result, <CODE>
MSG_META_DOC_OUTPUT_PHYSICAL_SAVE</CODE>
 will not be sent to the <CODE>
GenDocumentGroup</CODE>
 object's output. This is not usually a problem, since the application will generally handle one message or the other. If, for some reason, it needs to have both messages sent, the handler for <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_SAVE</CODE>
 should contain a <CODE>
@callsuper</CODE>
 instruction.

Document Control Data Fields</H2>
<P>
This section describes the attributes of the two document control classes,<EM>
 </EM>
<CODE>
GenDocumentControlClass</CODE>
 and <CODE>
GenDocumentGroupClass</CODE>
, as well as of the <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
. Note that GenDocument objects are created at run-time, and their attributes are initialized by the creating GenDocumentGroup object. However, their attributes can be changed with the appropriate messages.</P>
<P>
Many of the messages to the GenDocumentControl have corresponding messages to the GenDocumentGroup. For example, to find out the GenDocumentControl's attributes, one can either send a <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_CONTROL_GET_ATTRS</CODE>
 to the GenDocumentControl or send a <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_GROUP_GET_UI_ATTRS</CODE>
 to the GenDocumentGroup. In either case, the message will return the same result. It is sometimes more convenient to send a message to the GenDocumentGroup object; for example, a document object can do this with <CODE>
@call @genParent::&lt;message&gt;</CODE>

The attributes are</P>
<DL>
<DT CLASS="FIXME_WorListWide">
GDCA_MULTIPLE_OPEN_FILES</DT><DD>
Allow several documents to be open at once. If this attribute is disabled, the &quot;New&quot; and &quot;Open&quot; triggers will be disabled when a document is open (however, see also the description of the flag GDCF_SINGLE_FILE_CLEAN_CAN_NEW_OPEN on <A HREF="#Documents_6.htm_91918"> GDCF_SINGLE_FILE_CLEAN_CAN_NEW_OPEN This feature is ignored if the attribute GDCA_MULTIPLE_OPEN_FILES is on.

<DT CLASS="FIXME_WorListWide">
GDCA_MODE</DT><DD>
This is a two-bit field. GDCA_MODE is a mask of all the bits in this field; the offset of this field is equal to the constant GDCA_MODE_OFFSET. The field has the following possible settings:</DD>
<DT>
GDCM_VIEWER</DT><DD>
<A NAME="Documents_6.htm_IX_GDCM_&ldots;">
 </A>
All documents are opened in read-only mode; the New, Save, Save As, and Revert triggers are permanently disabled. Other applications can open the file for read/write access.</DD>
<DT>
GDCM_SHARED_SINGLE</DT><DD>
Documents are opened for reading and writing. When a document is open, it is marked &quot;deny-write&quot; so other applications can open the file only for read-only access. The user can mark a document as a &quot;public&quot; document, in which case the default is to open a file &quot;read-only.&quot; The default GDCA_MODE setting is GDCM_SHARED_SINGLE.</DD>
<DT>
GDCM_SHARED_MULTIPLE</DT><DD>
This mode is designed for documents that can have multiple writers, such as multi-user databases. Documents are ordinarily opened as in GDCM_SHARED_SINGLE mode above; however, a user can designate a file as a &quot;multi-user&quot; file, which means that it can be opened by several applications at once for read/write access.</DD>
<DT CLASS="FIXME_WorListWide">
</DT><DD>The default setting of the GDCA_MODE flag is GDCM_SHARED_SINGLE. If you want a different value, first clear the two-bit field, then set the new setting, like this:</DD>

<DT CLASS="FIXME_WorListWide">
GDCA_DOS_FILE_DENY_WRITE</DT><DD>
This attribute does not matter for VM files. If a DOS file is opened while the GDCA_DOS_FILE_DENY_WRITE bit is set, no other application will be able to write to that file. This is true even if the DOS file was opened for read-only access; however, if the file is a multi-user document opened in &quot;shared-multiple&quot; mode, other applications will be able to write to it regardless of whether the GDCA_DOS_FILE_DENY_WRITE attribute is set. By default, GDCA_DOS_FILE_DENY_WRITE is off.</DD>
<DT CLASS="FIXME_WorListWide">
GDCA_VM_FILE</DT><DD>
This attribute specifies whether the document control objects will open GEOS Virtual Memory files (if GDCA_VM_FILE is on), or DOS files (if GDCA_VM_FILE is off). The default value is on.</DD>
<DT CLASS="FIXME_WorListWide">
GDCA_NATIVE</DT><DD>
If this bit is set and GDCA_VM_FILE is not set, documents will be stored in the format native to the file-system.</DD>
<DT CLASS="FIXME_WorListWide">
GDCA_SUPPORTS_SAVE_AS_REVERT</DT><DD>
This attribute is ordinarily set only for GEOS files. If the attribute is on, the application will use the backup functionality of VM files to support &quot;Save As&quot; and &quot;Revert&quot; functionality. If the attribute is off, the file will be altered whenever it is updated to disk. The default value is on. DOS files do not normally support &quot;Save As&quot; and &quot;Revert.&quot; Applications can implement &quot;Save As&quot; and &quot;Revert&quot; functionality for DOS files by defining a subclass of <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
 with handlers for <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_PHYSICAL_SAVE_AS</CODE>
 and <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_PHYSICAL_REVERT</CODE>
, but this is not recommended. Ordinarily, this attribute should be off for DOS files.</DD>
<DT CLASS="FIXME_WorListWide">
GDCA_DOCUMENT_EXISTS</DT><DD>
This attribute is set and maintained at run-time by the GenDocumentControl code. The attribute is on if at least one document is open.</DD>
<DT CLASS="FIXME_WorListWide">
GDCA_CURRENT_TASK</DT><DD>
This three-bit attribute has a dual function: It determines the application's behavior at start-up, and it indicates what task the application is currently performing. The mask GDCA_CURRENT_TASK is a mask of all the bits in this field; the field's offset is equal to the constant GDCA_CURRENT_TASK_OFFSET. The possible settings are as follows:</DD>
<DT>
GDCT_NONE</DT><DD>

If a default file has been specified (see <A HREF="#Documents_6.htm_16472"> The GDCI_noNameText Field</A>

<DT>

A new document will be created at startup. If the GDCF_DIALOG_BOX_FOR_NEW flag is set, a dialog box will be presented at startup.</DD>
<DT>
GDCT_OPEN</DT><DD>
The &quot;Open File&quot; dialog box will be presented at startup.</DD>
<DT>
GDCT_USE_TEMPLATE</DT><DD>
The &quot;Use Template&quot; dialog box will be presented at startup.</DD>
<DT>
GDCT_SAVE_AS</DT><DD>
This is not a valid initial setting. The GDCA_CURRENT_TASK field has this setting between when a user chooses the &quot;Save As&quot; command and when the document is saved.</DD>
<DT>
GDCT_COPY_TO</DT><DD>
This is not a valid initial setting. The GDCA_CURRENT_TASK field has this setting between when the user chooses the &quot;Copy To&quot; command and when the command has been fully executed.</DD>

<P>
If a document is passed in to be opened at startup (as, for example, when a user launches an application by double-clicking a file created by the application), that file will be opened, and the initial setting of GDCA_CURRENT_TASK will be ignored. The document control automatically maintains this bitfield to correspond to whatever action the document control is currently taking. The application can find out what the document control is doing by reading the attributes and checking this field.</P>
<DL>
<DT CLASS="FIXME_WorListWide">
GDCA_DO_NOT_SAVE_FILES</DT><DD>

<A NAME="Documents_7.htm_IX_GDGI_genView">

The document control can be instructed to automatically connect the output of a GenView to the document object associated with the view. That way, the document object can handle all the messages relating to the view. This is naturally only done when the application is using the Object model; if it is using the Procedural model, a GenView will most likely send its messages to the Process object.</P>
<P>
There are two ways to enable this functionality. One way is appropriate only to single-document applications; the other is appropriate to multi-document applications.</P>
<P>
A single-document application using the Object model should declare the GenView normally as part of the generic tree. (It might well be placed on the GenDocumentControl object's <CODE>

GDGI_genView</CODE>
 field to be an optr to the GenView. When a document is opened, the document control will automatically set the GenView object to direct its output to the document object.</P>
<P>
A multi-document application using the Object model should use the document control's ability to create and manage GenDisplay objects. The application will have a resource which is duplicated for each open document. This resource will contain a generic tree, at the head of which is a GenDisplay. To use a GenView, all the application has to do is put a GenView in the tree headed by that GenDisplay, and set <CODE>

Every GEOS file (and each application that creates such files) has a protocol associated with it. Protocols are used to make sure an application knows if a given document was created by a different version of the application. They are stored in the file's FEA_PROTOCOL extended attributes (see <A HREF="../../Files/FileSys/FileSys_d.htm#47278">the File System chapter</A>). The protocol is of the form &quot;MAJOR.MINOR,&quot; where both &quot;MAJOR&quot; and &quot;MINOR&quot; are 16-bit unsigned integers. The application's protocol is specified by the <CODE>GDGI_protocolMajor</EM>
 and <CODE>
GDGI_protocolMinor</CODE>
 attributes of the GenDocumentGroup object. </P>
<P>
All documents created by an application will have the application's protocol number. If a document has the same major protocol number as the application but a lower minor protocol number, the document is compatible with the application. If the document has a lower major protocol number, the document is incompatible with the application; it can be opened only if a routine has been defined to upgrade the document. If the document has a higher protocol than the application (i.e. its major protocol number is higher, or it has the same major protocol number and a higher minor protocol number), the document control will not open the file; it will present an error message. By default, the GenDocumentGroup<CODE>
 </CODE>
object has a <CODE>
GDGI_protocolMajor</CODE>
 of one and a <CODE>
GDGI_protocolMinor</CODE>
 of zero.</P>
<P>
When the user opens an earlier but compatible document, the GenDocumentGroup opens the file and attaches it to a document object. Then, the (newly-created) document object sends itself <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_UPDATE_EARLIER_COMPATIBLE_DOCUMENT;</CODE>
 the GenDocumentGroup then sends its output object the message <CODE>
MSG_META_DOC_OUTPUT_UPDATE_EARLIER_COMPATIBLE_DOCUMENT</CODE>
. If neither of these messages is handled, the document will be opened as if it were of the current protocol (since it is compatible). Often an application will not handle these messages.</P>
<P>
If the user tries to open an earlier and incompatible document, the GenDocumentGroup opens the file and attaches it to a document object. Then, the document object sends a <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_UPDATE_EARLIER_INCOMPATIBLE_DOCUMENT</CODE>
 to itself, and the GenDocumentGroup sends a <CODE>
MSG_META_DOC_OUTPUT_UPDATE_EARLIER_INCOMPATIBLE_DOCUMENT</CODE>
 to its output. If neither message is handled, the GenDocumentGroup closes the file unchanged and removes the document object, and the GenDocumentControl presents an error message (since the document is incompatible). If either message is handled, the document will be opened normally after the handler exits.</P>
<P>
Note that the document control will not automatically change the protocol number for a file after it has been updated. If you wish this done, you should have the handler for the message call one of the routines to change the FEA_PROTOCOL extended attribute.</P>

Basic DC Messages</H2>
<P>
The document control objects use messages for many things. Since well over half a dozen classes of objects (counting file selectors, GenDisplayGroup objects, menu triggers, etc.) and far more actual objects are involved in intricate tasks, many messages are continually sent back and forth. Most of these messages are transparent to the programmer. The programmer need only know about them if the program subclasses a message to add functionality to it; this is an advanced technique which few programs will ever need to use.</P>
<P>
There are two basic types of messages the programmer needs to know about. First, there are messages which are sent to document control objects; these objects may query information, toggle some functionality, or otherwise instruct the DC objects to take some action. Second, there are messages the DC objects send when the programmer's code needs to take some action. Each type of message is treated in a separate section.</P>

The following are the messages a program might ordinarily send to the GenDocumentGroup object. Many of these messages request information about the GenDocumentControl object or the target document; others request information about the GenDocumentGroup object or instruct it to take actions. Many of the messages require, as an argument, an optr to a document object; however, a null object-pointer can be passed, thus indicating the target document. This is especially useful under single-document models; the application doesn't need to keep track of the document object's optr, since it is always the target document.</P>

<A HREF="#index.htm">Documents</A>: 3.2 <A HREF="#Documents_9.htm">Basic DC Messages</A>: 
From the Doc Control Objects</H3>
<P>
Often the document control will need to notify the application to take an action. For example, when a document is created, the application needs to be told to initialize the document and the user interface. There are two basic models for handling these situations: the &quot;Procedure&quot; model and the &quot;Object&quot; model. (The differences between these models are discussed at more length in the section <A HREF="#Documents_4.htm_16929"> Document Control Models</A>
.) Each model has its own way of messaging.</P>
<P>
Under the Procedure model, every time the application needs to be notified, the document control sends a message to the GenDocumentGroup's output object, which is ordinarily the process object. Under the Object model, the affected document object will send a message to itself; this message has no handler under <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
, so the application must use a subclass of <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
 with handlers for these messages.</P>
<P>
A single user action can generate several messages. For example, when the user opens a document, four messages are sent: <CODE>
MSG_..._PHYSICAL_OPEN</CODE>
,<CODE>
 MSG_..._READ_CACHED_DATA_FROM_FILE</CODE>
,<CODE>
 MSG_..._CREATE_UI_FOR_DOCUMENT</CODE>
, and <CODE>
MSG_..._ATTACH_UI_TO_DOCUMENT</CODE>
. Furthermore, a given message might be sent as the result of several different user actions; for example, the message MSG_..._CREATE_UI_FOR_DOCUMENT is sent when the user creates a new file or opens an existing one. If a handler needs to know what user action precipitated a given message, it can send a <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_GET_OPERATION</CODE>
 to the document object.</P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Messages Handled under the Procedure Model</H4>
<P>
Whenever the application needs to be notified to take an action, a message will be sent to the GenDocumentGroup's output object. Two arguments accompany such messages: A pointer to the relevant document object and the handle of the file associated with that document. All of these messages are exported from <CODE>
MetaClass</CODE>
, so they can be handled by objects of any class.</P>
<P>
Each of these messages corresponds to a document-model message, all of which are described in <A HREF="#Documents_b.htm_18073"> Messages Handled under the Object Model</A>

A single user action can precipitate several application-handled messages. This section lists the messages associated with each of several common user actions.

By now, you should know enough for most uses of the document control. For single-document applications which manage GEOS Virtual Memory files and use a generic interface, the above documentation should be sufficient. However, there are some needs which require more advanced techniques. This section details these techniques.</P>
<P>
This section discusses the use of document protocols to smooth the process of upgrading software. It also discusses using the document control to manage multiple documents simultaneously and to manage DOS files. Finally, it discusses those messages which an application might need to handle but would not ordinarily need to know about.</P>

<P>
One difficulty in upgrading software is that an obsolete program may have created many documents. If the new version can't read those documents, people who used the old version will be inconvenienced; however, if the new versions always use the same document formats as the old versions, options for improvement will be limited. Above all, if document formats change, the new version should detect this gracefully, without crashing or damaging the old file.</P>
<P>
The header for a GEOS Virtual Memory file contains two words for protocol numbers. The document control objects use the protocol numbers to insure that a document is compatible with the version of the application which is opening it. There are two parts to the protocol number: the <EM>
major</EM>
 protocol number, and the <EM>
minor</EM>
 protocol number. (If a document has a major protocol number of 3 and a minor number of 11, it is referred to has having protocol 3.11.) By convention, versions of an application with entirely compatible document formats will have the same major protocol number; if a new version of an application cannot read older documents without converting them in some way, it will have a higher major protocol number, and the minor number will be reset to zero.</P>
<P>
When the GenDocumentGroup object opens a file, it checks the major and minor protocol numbers. It will then take appropriate action:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
If the document's major and minor protocol numbers match the protocol attributes of the GenDocumentGroup object, the document will be opened normally. </LI>
<LI>
If the document has a higher protocol number than the GenDocumentGroup (i.e. either the document has a higher major protocol number, or the document and the GenDocumentGroup have the same major protocol number and the document has a higher minor protocol number), the document control will display an appropriate alert box, after which it will close the file and delete the document object. (It will do all of this automatically, without any attention from the application.) </LI>
<LI>
If the document has lower major protocol number than the document control, the document control will send <CODE>
MSG_META_DOC_OUTPUT_UPDATE_EARLIER_INCOMPATIBLE_DOCUMENT</CODE>
 (and a corresponding <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_...</CODE>
). If neither message is handled, or if a handler returns an error, the document control will display an alert box and will close the file and delete the document object. </LI>
<LI>
If the document has the same major but a lower minor protocol number than the GenDocumentGroup, the document control will send <CODE>
MSG_META_DOC_OUTPUT_UPDATE_EARLIER_COMPATIBLE_DOCUMENT</CODE>
 (and a corresponding <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_...</CODE>
). After this, it will proceed normally, whether the messages were handled or not (since the document is presumed to be compatible). If a handler returns an error, it will close the file and free the document object.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Note that the document control will not change the file under any of these circumstances. In particular, if it opens an earlier document, it will not change the document's protocol number. If the application wishes to do this, it should do it explicitly (generally in the handlers for the &quot;<CODE>
UPDATE_..._DOCUMENT</CODE>
&quot; messages). The protocol numbers are among a file's extended attributes. For information about changing extended attributes, see <A HREF="../../Files/FileSys/FileSys_d.htm#49785">the File System chapter</A>.</P>

Multiple Document Model</H3>
<P>
The Object model of document control makes it easy to manage several documents at once. Effectively, each document object acts as a special-purpose application dedicated to handling one file. The display control lets the user change documents at will. The document control and display control take care of most of the nuts and bolts of file switching, so the application doesn't have to worry about them.</P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Subclassing GenDocumentClass</H4>
<P>
Under the object model of document control, a document's functionality is implemented as methods in the document class. Much of the switching between documents is thus transparent to the application. When the target changes, all user actions will result in messages being sent to the new target document; whenever a document gets a message, it knows the message pertains to itself, not some other document (and thus knows that it is the target document).</P>
<P>
In order to implement this functionality, the application must declare a subclass of <CODE>
GenDocumentClass</CODE>
. This subclass will have its own methods for application-handled messages.</P>


<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Using the Display Group</H4>
<P>
The simplest way to manage multiple documents is to use the display control. The display control lets the user change documents transparently to the application. In order to do this, the application must define a resource of objects which should be copied each time a document is opened or created. The GenDocumentGroup object's <CODE>
GDGI_genDisplay</CODE>
 attribute should be set to point to a GenDisplay object in that resource; the GenDisplay should be set &quot;not usable&quot; and should be the head of a tree of objects. Also, the application should define an object of <CODE>
GenDisplayGroupClass</CODE>
, and the GenDocumentGroup's <CODE>
GDGI_genDisplayGroup</CODE>
 attribute should be set to point to it. The display control will then automatically switch displays whenever the user chooses an entry from the display control.</P>

Working with DOS files</H3>

<P>
The document control can be used to handle DOS files. However, there are special issues to be aware of. When you use GEOS Virtual Memory files, the system takes care of swapping sections of the file in and out of memory as needed. You can use high-level commands to mark parts of the file as dirty, and when you need the document saved, only the dirty sections will be copied to the disk. The details of reading from and writing to the disk are transparent to the application.</P>
<P>
When you use DOS files, on the other hand, you have to take care of all of these details yourself. It is usually impractical to keep all of a document in memory at one time, so you have to have some way of managing the data (perhaps by creating a temporary VM file and copying the DOS file into that).</P>
<P>
For this reason, the document control sends out messages when it does many low-level things (such as save files). If the application needs to take special actions, it can define handlers for these messages. Most of these messages can be ignored if you are working with GEOS files. </P>
<P>
If you want to implement &quot;Save As&quot; and &quot;Revert&quot; for DOS files, you will have to do most of it by hand. If you leave &quot;Save As&quot; and &quot;Revert&quot; enabled, the Document Control will do some of the work for you. For example, when the user chooses &quot;Save As&quot;, the Document Control will first present a File Selector, letting the user choose a file name and location. The Document Control will then create the new file. After this it will send out MSG_META_DOC_OUTPUT_PHYSICAL_SAVE_AS_FILE_HANDLE and MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_PHYSICAL_SAVE_AS_FILE_HANDLE, passing the handle of the newly-created file. The application is responsible for writing the current version of the document to the new file, and reverting the original file to its last-saved state. The Document Control will automatically close the original file and update all Document Control instance data as necessary.</P>

Special-Purpose Messages</H3>
<P>
In addition to the basic messages discussed above, there are messages the document control sends out which do not ordinarily need to be handled. Some of these messages have been discussed above; most of the rest are described here.</P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Caching Data in Memory</H4>
<PRE>MSG_META_DOC_OUTPUT_WRITE_CACHED_DATA_TO_FILE, MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_WRITE_CACHED_DATA_TO_FILE, MSG_META_DOC_OUTPUT_READ_CACHED_DATA_FROM_FILE, MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_READ_CACHED_DATA_FROM_FILE</PRE>
<P>
Sometimes an application will want to keep frequently-accessed data in memory. For example, if you are managing Virtual Memory files, you may want to copy the map block to a fixed memory block instead of locking the block every time you need to read or change it. This is known as <EM>
caching</EM>
 data.</P>
<P>
If you cache data, you must make sure that the application's version of the data is consistent with the disk file. The document control helps keep track of this. Whenever the file (or the state) is saved, the document control will first send a message instructing the application to write the cache to the file, then it will save the file. Similarly, when the file is opened or GEOS is restarted from state, the document control will send a message instructing the application to reload the cached data from the file.</P>
<P>
There is one special concern. The user cannot save a file unless it has been marked dirty; also, the document control does not send <CODE>
MSG_..._WRITE_CACHED_DATA_TO_FILE</CODE>
 to documents which are not dirty. Therefore, if you change the data cache without actually altering the file, you should send a <CODE>
MSG_GEN_DOCUMENT_GROUP_MARK_DIRTY</CODE>
 to the GenDocumentGroup.</P>

<P>
The GenDocumentGroup sends this message when the document needs to read cached data. In particular, it sends this when a document is opened, when a document is reverted to its last-saved state, and when a document is re-opened as GEOS restores from state. If the application maintains a data cache, it should read the data from the file at this point. If the document does not cache data, it can ignore this message.</P>

The following messages are for internal use by the Document Control objects only. The GenDocumentControl object sends each of these messages to an appropriate GenDocument object to instruct it to perform a certain action; no intervention by the application is necessary, or appropriate.

Any application which does this must make sure to call the superclass without changing any of the arguments.</P>

Several of these messages pass, as an argument, a structure of type <CODE>
