This chapter shows how you might get started 
writing a simple GEOS program, and it explains several fundamental GEOS 
programming concepts as it goes along. Although this tutorial explicitly refers
to the Nokia 9000 SDK version 1.1, it is also applies to the Nokia 9000i SDK version 2.0.

<H1 CLASS="chapterTitle">
Getting Started with GEOS Programming
</H1>
<P>
Before jumping into writing your own application, it might be useful to
compile and run an existing sample application. This chapter will take you through the generic steps of checking out a source file, compiling it, then running the compiled application on the emulator with the Swat debugger attached. 
The next two chapters explore GEOS development in greater detail by stepping through every step in creating the application &quot;Tutorial&quot;. We recommend that you step through this chapter to acquaint yourself with the generic process of compiling an application, then carefully follow the tutorial to get a flavor for GOC, Swat debugging, and Geode Parameter files.</P>
<P>
Typically, your development sequence will follow these steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
Check out a file by copying it to your Working Branch. This is your private development area. By doing your work here, the Branch files remain untouched (see <A HREF = "../../Intro/InstallSDK/NT-Tools_f.htm#76945">&quot;Developing In Your Working Branch&quot;</A> for more information);</LI>
<LI>
Create a Makefile using the <CODE>
mkmf</CODE>
 utility;</LI>
<LI>
Compile your application using the <CODE>
pmake</CODE>
 utility;</LI>
<LI>
Run the application on the error-checking version of the target emulator; </LI>
<LI>
Debug your application using the Swat debugger; and</LI>
<LI>
Edit your source code and go back to Step 3.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
The next section follows this sequence using the Dialogs sample application, though of course the same steps apply for any sample application. (Refer to the release notes in the README.TXT file or the <A HREF = "../../Intro/Tutorial/startgeos.htm">Troubleshooting</A> guide in the <A HREF = "../../Intro/InstallSDK/index.htm">&quot;Installing the SDK&quot; chapter</A> if you encounter problems.)</P>
<P>
In the directory paths below, prepend your correct drive letter or path to PCGEOS and replace &quot;workingdir&quot; as appropriate. Also note that if you are using the Nokia 9000i SDK version 2.0, the directory labled here as <CODE>N9000v11</CODE> will be <CODE>N9000v20</CODE> in your development branch.</P>
<OL>
<LI>
Install the SDK by following the instructions in the <A HREF = "../../Intro/InstallSDK/index.htm">&quot;Installing the SDK&quot;</A> chapter;</LI>
<LI>
Start a command window.</LI>
<LI>
Go to the \APPL\ subdirectory of your Working Directory:</LI>
<PRE>CD PCGEOS\workingdir\APPL</PRE>
<LI>
Create and go to the subdirectory \SDK_9000\DIALOGS\:</LI>
<PRE>MD SDK_9000\DIALOGS
CD SDK_9000\DIALOGS</PRE>
<LI>
Copy the file <STRONG CLASS="fileName">
DIALOGS.GOC</STRONG>
 from the N9000v11 Branch to this directory:</LI>
<PRE>COPY \PCGEOS\N9000V11\APPL\SDK_9000\DIALOGS\DIALOGS.GOC</PRE>
<LI>
Type <CODE>
mkmf</CODE>
 to create the makefile.</LI>
<LI>
Type <CODE>
pmake</CODE>
 to compile and link the executable. This will create an error-checking version called <STRONG CLASS="fileName">
DIALOGSEC.GEO</STRONG>
.</LI>
<LI>
Launch a wait-for-swat EC demo. You can do this from the GEOS SDK program menu if the shortcuts were installed; otherwise, CD to \PCGEOS\workingdir\TARGET\N9000.EC, then type <CODE>
start ss</CODE>
.</LI>
<LI>
Launch Swat. You can also do this from the GEOS SDK program menu; otherwise, type<CODE>
 start pcgeos\bin\swat</CODE>
. (The full path is only necessary if there is also a Swat stub in your current directory, which you <EM>
do not </EM>
want to run.)</LI>
<UL>
<LI>
If Swat pauses with a top-level prompt (=&gt;), type <CODE>
c</CODE>
 to continue. </LI>
<LI>
If Swat cannot file a symbol file, press <CODE>
Ctrl-W</CODE>
 to clear the &quot;Where is it&quot; default; then type <CODE>
i</CODE>
 (lower-case) to ignore that file.</LI>
<LI>
If Swat is searching a very long time for a particular symbol file (Looking for &quot;such-and-such&quot;...), you can abort the search by typing <CODE>
Ctrl-C</CODE>
, then using the <CODE>
Ctrl-W</CODE>
, <CODE>
i</CODE>
 sequence described above to ignore the file. </LI>
</UL>
<LI>
When the emulator has finished loading (usually after &quot;serial&quot; exits), press <CODE>
Ctrl-C</CODE>
 in the Swat window to bring command control back to Swat.</LI>
<LI>
Copy your geode (your compiled executable) to the target emulator by typing<CODE>
 send dialogs</CODE>
.</LI>
<LI>
Type <CODE>
c</CODE>
 to continue Swat.</LI>
<LI>
Click inside the emulator window to regain focus in that window. Press <CODE>
Ctrl-F12</CODE>
 to launch the Extras folder.</LI>
<LI>
Use the arrow keys to highlight the EC Dialogs application. Press <CODE>
F1</CODE>
 to launch it. (The keys F1 - F4 correspond to the menu list on the right of the emulator window.)</LI>
<LI>Play with the application.</LI>
<LI>
Select the Swat window, press <CODE>
Ctrl-C</CODE> to bring command control back to Swat, then type <CODE>
quit</CODE>
 to exit the emulator.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
In this section, you learned how to check out a source code file by copying it from the Branch directory to your Working Directory, and then compile and run it on the emulator. Notice that it was not necessary to copy all the files from the \DIALOGS\ subdirectory in the N9000v11 Branch. When compiling and linking, the tools are smart enough to look for files in your Working Directory first and then look for whatever other files it needs in the Branch directory. This allows you to copy only the file or files you need to work on; shared files can remain in the Branch directory. </P>
<P>
Now that you've gone through the basic steps of compiling and running a GEOS application, you can go on to <A HREF="#tutorial.htm">the next chapter</A> to create your own application from scratch.</P>

In this tutorial, you will create a simple GEOS application that draws text and demonstrates the basic components of a GEOS application. You'll learn how to compile and link the application and explore its source code using the Swat debugger.</P>

The first step in creating your application is to set up your Working Directory where you will do all your private development. Because your application is called &quot;Tutorial,&quot; you need to create a <STRONG CLASS="fileName">\TUTORIAL\</STRONG>

Typing source code by hand is often a good way to learn the feel for a language's grammar.

<P>
By typing in the contents of the source files (both the .GOC and .GP files), you've probably become a little familiar with GOC syntax. GOC is a proprietary superset of standard ANSI C. It supports C routines and functionality and adds its own set of keywords and special syntax. This section will cover basic GOC syntax, including the usage and meaning of various GOC keywords, by giving a line-by-line explanation of the code you entered.</P>

<P>
We certainly got a lot of data from that command! </P>
<PRE>*TutorialView{GenViewClass} (@5, ^l5230h:0020h)</PRE>
<P>
The first line gives the object's class, shortcut and pointer information, similar to the output from <CODE>gentree</CODE>. 
The rest of the output consists of the object's instance data. For example:</P>
<PRE>GenViewDimensionAttrs GVI_horizAttrs = { GVDA_DONT_DISPLAY_SCROLLBAR,
GVDA_NO_LARGER_THAN_CONTENT}</PRE>
<P>
These lines show which flags (of type <CODE>GenViewDimensionAttrs</CODE>) 
are set for the object's <CODE>
GVI_horizAttrs</CODE>
 instance data field. Notice that Swat displays both the flag set in your source code, <CODE>GVDA_NO_LARGER_THAN_CONTENT</CODE>, as well as the default flag set by the system, <CODE>GVDA_DONT_DISPLAY_SCROLLBAR</CODE>. </P>
<P>
You may recognize some of the instance data fields from your source code. Other fields you may not recognize because you didn't specify values for these fields, allowing the system to use default values instead.</P>
<P>
With <CODE>
pobj</CODE>
, you took advantage of another Swat feature: command completion. 
There is no &quot;<CODE>pobj</CODE>&quot; 
Swat command; the command's name is really 
&quot;<CODE>pobject</CODE>.&quot; Because 
&quot;<CODE>pobject</CODE>&quot; was the only 
Swat command that begins with p-o-b-j, Swat realized what you meant when you used 
&quot;<CODE>pobj</CODE>.&quot;</P>
