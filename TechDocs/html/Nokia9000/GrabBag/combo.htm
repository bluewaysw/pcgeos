<STRONG>Processor</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>The phone functions are based on a Nokia 2110i.
<LI>9000/9000i Communicators run on a 24 MHz 80386 chip; the 9110 Communicator uses an AMD 486 processor.
</UL>
<P>

<A NAME = "memory"></A>
<STRONG>Memory</STRONG>
<P>
The Nokia 9000i Communicator has 8 megabytes of Flash RAM in it. It is partitioned as follows:<BR>
<DL>
 <DD>                  4 MB for "ROM" for the OS and applications 
  <DD>                 2 MB for application execution and heap space
    <DD>               2 MB for user data storage (essentially a RAM disk)
</DL>

<A NAME = "mmc"></A>
<STRONG>Memory Cards</STRONG>
<P>The Nokia 9110 Communicator has a memory card slot. To insert the postage-stamp size memory card, you must
turn off the device, remove the battery, and insert the card behind the battery. A memory card can provide up to 
4 MB of additional Flash RAM or ROM, but future cards could provide even more memory. Since memory cards use a 32 bit 
address, they have a theoretical 4 GB upper limit.</P>

<P>
<A NAME = "display"></A>
<STRONG>Screen display</STRONG>
<P>
The display is a grayscale LCD screen 640x200 pixels, measuring 115 by 36 millimeters.  The screen is neither touch-sensitive nor pen operable. The left status pane is 80 pixels wide and the command buttons at the right have a variable width, so an application's usable screen dimensions will be less than or equal to 560x200 pixels. For instance, the web browser has 540x200 pixels of usable display for web pages.
<P>
Nokia 9000i Communicators support 4 levels of gray, and the newer Nokia 9110 Communicators support 
4-bit color (displays 16 levels of gray). Even though the 4-bit color devices 
default to 4 levels of gray, applications may change modes on-the-fly. 
<P>
<A NAME = "keyboard"></A>
<STRONG>Keyboard</STRONG>
<P>
The keyboard is a standard QWERTY keyboard. English, French German
and Scandinavian versions are currently available.
<P>
<A NAME = "communication"></A>
<STRONG>Communication</STRONG>
<UL>
<LI>Cellular (voice and data)
	<UL>
	<LI> Communication is through the GSM digital network, which can transmit
	         cellular voice, data (and fax) and SMS alpha-numeric pages.
		<UL>
		<LI> GSM's Short Message Service (SMS) allows mobile devices to send short, 160 
character messages as a single packet of information. Nokia 9000i Communicators can send and receive these messages, and route them to specified target applications.
		</UL>
	<LI>E-mail conforms to the SMTP and business card standards.
	<LI>Internet protocols: TCP/IP and PPP.
	<LI>The maximum baud rate for data calls is 9600 baud (14,400 baud on 9110 Communicators).
	</UL>

<LI>The Nokia 9000i supports two COM ports:<BR>
 	<UL>
	<LI>COM1 is the serial port
	<LI>COM3 is the infrared port
	<LI>(COM2 used internally so it is not available to applications.)

<H3>Communicator Grays</H3>
Nokia 9000i Communicators support 4 levels of gray and the newer Nokia 9110 Communicators support 4-bit color,
even though the display is grayscale (16 shades of gray). There are two different grayscale schemes used, 
one for visMonikers and icons, and the other for normal GEOS drawing routines. 
<P>
<A NAME = "icongray"></A>
Icons can make use of 4 levels of grey. When drawing an icon, use the following mapping of 
colors to create the correct gray level in the icon: (if other color values are used, they will not show up on 
9000i devices).

<H3>UI Conventions: Triggers</H3>
	
<P>
<A NAME = "trigger_usage"></A>
<STRONG>Trigger Usage</STRONG>
<P>
To maintain a consistent look-and-feel for all Nokia 9000i applications, it is important that developers follow the same set of UI conventions. The most important navigation tool on the Nokia 9000i are the four triggers at the right side (see below).
<P>
<CENTER>
<TABLE BORDER = 3 WIDTH = 640>
<TR><TD>
<IMG SRC = "menu_example1.gif" WIDTH = 640 Height = 204>
<BR>
<EM>&quot;Call&quot;, &quot;Voice mailbox&quot; and &quot;Recent calls&quot; are this application's triggers. &quot;Call&quot; is in slot 0, &quot;Voice mailbox&quot; is in slot 2, etc. This particular application does not use slot 3.</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>
<P>

 The application specifies what these triggers are and which slot (0, 1, 2, or 3) each of these triggers belongs in. Newer versions of the Communicator (software verions 4.8 or later) support a fifth trigger, the menu trigger (see <A HREF = "#menu_trigger">below</A>). In general, applications should use:

<DL>
<DT>HINT_SEEK_SLOT = 0
	<DD>The main action (such as Open or Send).
      		Affirmative responses (such as OK).
<P>
<DT> HINT_SEEK_SLOT = 1
	<DD>Secondary functions or Main function if slot 0 is taken.
<P>
<DT> HINT_SEEK_SLOT = 2:
     	<DD>Settings and similar buttons that bring up options.
      		Apply trigger in dialogs. 
<P>
<DT>  HINT_SEEK_SLOT = 3:
      		<DD>Negative responses such as Cancel, Close, or Dismiss.
      		Back triggers.  (Back is <STRONG>always</STRONG> in slot 3.  This is
      		the trigger with ATTR_TLT_IS_BACK_TRIGGER set.)
     		 "OK" if it is for dismissing the dialog box or if
     		 there are no other buttons.
     		 Settings can go here is slot 2 is already taken. 
</DL>
<P>

Applications launched from "Extras" must have a close button that calls <CODE>MSG_FSA_RETURN_TO_LAUNCHER</CODE>

<P>
You can use up to 6 triggers by setting up two panes of triggers. If this is done, than the fourth trigger of each group must be either "More" or "Back" text monikers with the associated right and left pointing icons. 

<P>
<STRONG>
<A NAME = "menu_trigger"></A>
Menu Trigger
</STRONG>
<P>
Software versions 4.8 or later of the Communicator allow for a fifth &quot;Menu&quot; trigger that behaves just like a regular trigger except that it is invisible and does not take up a slot at the right side of the screen. It is activated whenever the user pushes the &quot;Menu&quot; button present on newer versions of the Communicator.

</CENTER>


<P>
To create a menu trigger, follow the same steps for creating a normal trigger but do not designate a HINT_SEEK_SLOT = {0,...,3} and set <CODE>CMI_topText = CMT_MENU;</CODE>. This automatically distinguishes it as a menu trigger. For more information, refer to <A HREF = "../UI/9000UI_6.htm">ComplexMoniker Usage</A>.
<P>
Ctrl-F2 corresponds to the menu button on the emulator.

<HR>
<A NAME = "zoom"></A>
<H3>Zoom Levels</H3>
<P>
On versions 4.8.8 or later of the 9000i Communicator, the user can press an off-screen &quot;Zoom&quot; button to toggle between three text size settings -- &quot;Zoom&quot; levels -- and adjust the text size for comfortable reading.

<EM>High zoom. Note that only some parts of the UI are enlarged as the user chooses a higher zoom level. It would be impossible to fit larger triggers into the four slots, or increase the size of the clock.</EM>
<P>
</TD></TR>
</TABLE>
</CENTER>

<P>
On the emulator, the &quot;Zoom&quot; button is mapped to Ctrl-F1.
<P>
Use <CODE>HINT_MAXIMUM_ZOOM_LEVEL</CODE> to determine the maximum size that a UI component may be zoomed. <CODE>HINT_MAXIMUM_ZOOM_LEVEL = ZL_ZOOM_1;</CODE> implies that the component will not be zoomed at all, whereas <CODE>HINT_MAXIMUM_ZOOM_LEVEL = ZL_ZOOM_3;</CODE> implies that a UI component can be zoomed at the normal, medium, or maximum zoom levels. 
<P>
The higher the zoom level, the larger the font size, and the fewer the number of characters that will fit into a fixed pixel length field. Thus, if you use a <CODE>CreateVisMoniker...()</CODE> routine, you should use the routines <CODE>FoomZoomGetLevel()</CODE> and <CODE>FoamConvertToZoomedSize()</CODE> to take the zoom level into consideration and create a VisMoniker of appropriate size.

<PRE>      000000/00/2a0030808044001/0. </PRE>

<P>
The interesting part is: 2a0030808044001. The three first characters 
identify hardware version (here 2.10), six following characters identify 
software version (here 03.08.08), three following characters identify the 
country code (44 = Great Britain) and the last three characters identify 
the keyboard type (here 001 = English).

<P>
Here is sample code that shows how to extract the version information:
<PRE> 
                 @start StringRes;
                     @chunk TCHAR UICategory[] = "ui";
                     @chunk TCHAR SWSerialNumber[] = "swSerialNumber";
                 @end StringRes;
                      
                 ...
                      
                 @method TestProcessClass, MSG_TEST_PROCESS_GET_VERSION
                 {
                     TCHAR   version[28] = "";
                     TCHAR * category;
                     TCHAR * key;
                     word    value;
                      
                     MemLock( OptrToHandle( @UICategory ) ); 
                     category = (TCHAR *) LMemDeref( @UICategory ); 
                     key      = (TCHAR *) LMemDeref( @SWSerialNumber ); 
                     InitFileReadStringBuffer( category,
                          key,
                          version,
                          IFRF_SIZE | 28,
                          &value );

                     /*
                      * Extract the information you want from version string. 
                      */
                     MemUnlock( OptrToHandle( @UICategory ) );
                 }

<H3>Lid-closing Event</H3>
<P>
After the Nokia 9000i Communicator's lid is closed, the Communicator waits for 30 seconds and then turns off the CPU. Of course, the CPU will not turn off until all applications are idle.

<P>To receive notification that the lid is closed, an application should 
register on the GCN list <CODE>GCNSLT_RESPONDER_NOTIFICATIONS</CODE>.  
It should watch for <CODE>MSG_META_NOTIFY</CODE> with 
<CODE>notificationType == GWNT_RESPONDER_NOTIFICATION</CODE>,
<CODE>manufID == MANUFACTURER_ID_GEOWORKS</CODE> and 
<CODE>data == RNT_LID_CLOSED</CODE>.
(<CODE>ResponderNotificationType</CODE> is defined in N9000v20\CInclude\Internal\respondr.goh)

<H3>Debugging an actual Nokia 9000i Communicator</H3>
<P>
To debug on an actual Nokia 9000i Communicator, you need to attach your
host PC to the device's 6-pin serial port. Then run the GEOS Setup program
and change the "Communication Mode" to Remote and set the "Comm Speed" to
38400. Which "COMM Port" you use depends on which port on your PC you have
used to connect to the phone. Remove the battery so the phone shuts down.
Then replace the battery and press:

<P>
SHIFT-D-O (that is 'oh' not zero) to boot and wait for swat to attach.<BR>
SHIFT-D-B to boot with swat stub loaded, but doesn't wait for swat to attach.
</P>

<P>
Note that IR connections and PC connectivity won't work while the Nokia
9000i Communicator is in debug mode. (IR shares a UART with the swat port,
so you trying to open the port will lock the device.) 
</P>

<P>
Also note that debugging on the device is limited because you cannot set 
breakpoints in any of the system routines (since they are in ROM).
Mostly you can check backtraces and set breakpoints in your own
application.
