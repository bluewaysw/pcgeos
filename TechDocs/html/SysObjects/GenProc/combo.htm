 is the class that you will use to define the Process object of your applications. This class includes some functionality for opening and closing geodes as well as saving to and restoring from state files. Typically, your application will define its own subclass of <CODE>
GenProcessClass</CODE>
; this subclass will be used as your Process object and will receive all messages destined for the Process.</P>
<P>
In this subclass you can alter the <CODE>
GenProcessClass</CODE>
, <CODE>
ProcessClass</CODE>
, or <CODE>
MetaClass</CODE>
 messages you need. More often, however, the subclass will be used to define new messages that are application-global or that should be handled by your Process object.</P>

Many of the following messages need <CODE>
AppAttachFlags</CODE>
 to tell them how the process is attaching:</P>
<PRE>typedef WordFlags AppAttachFlags;
#define AAF_RESTORING_FROM_STATE						0x8000
#define AAF_STATE_FILE_PASSED						0x4000
#define AAF_DATA_FILE_PASSED						0x2000
#define AAF_RESTORING_FROM_QUIT						0x1000</PRE>
<UL>
<LI>
AAF_RESTORING_FROM_STATE indicates that the application is coming up from a previous state, either by re-launching using a state file, or re-entering application mode from engine mode in the same session. The UI trees will be in whatever state they were left in, which may be different than the statically declared UI tree, depending on what occurred in the application when the state file was written out (for example, a dialog box may have been on-screen). If this flag is <EM>
false</EM>
, the application is starting up fresh. If this flag is <EM>
true</EM>
, the UI does not call MSG_META_LOAD_OPTIONS and ignores any &quot;ON_STARTUP&quot; hints or attributes.</LI>
<LI>
AAF_STATE_FILE_PASSED indicates that the application is restoring from the state file passed in an <CODE>
AppLaunchBlock</CODE>
, presumably passed as an argument in the message also. If this flag is set, AAF_RESTORING_FROM_STATE will also be set.</LI>
<LI>
AAF_DATA_FILE_PASSED indicates that the passed <CODE>
AppLaunchBlock</CODE>
 contains the name of a data file that should be opened.</LI>
<LI>
AAF_RESTORING_FROM_QUIT indicates that the application was in the process of quitting, reached engine mode, and is now being started back up into application mode. If set, will also be set, and we will be brought up in whatever state we originally entered engine mode.</LI>

This message is sent by the User Interface when an application is being loaded from its resource blocks. Applications will often intercept this message to set up certain things before being put on-screen. This is the handler in which, for example, you would register for certain notifications such as the quick-transfer notification.</P>
<P>
This is sent to the process itself from <CODE>
MSG_META_ATTACH</CODE>
, whenever the application is being restored to application mode (as opposed to engine mode), or whenever it is being invoked as in application mode. Data passed is the same as that in <CODE>
MSG_META_ATTACH</CODE>

<P>
This message may be intercepted to open up any data file passed, before the UI for the application is actually set GS_USABLE. Note that the blocks passed need not be freed, as this is done by the caller upon return.</P>
<P>
If you intercept this message and need to send MSG_META_QUIT from within the handler, make sure to either send the quit after calling the superclass, or send the quit via MSG_META_FLUSH_INPUT_QUEUE. (If this is not done, the system will think that an IACP connection is open, aborting the quit.)</P>

The handler here merely sends the request on to GenApplication using <CODE>

One such failure case which is fixed is two target text objects, one run by the process thread in a view, the other a GenText run by the UI thread. If the GenText has the target and the user clicks quickly on view then GenText, the GenText may process both messages about the target being lost and gained before the process text object receives its gained and lost pair. If both objects sent <CODE>
MSG_META_GCN_LIST_SEND</CODE>
 directly to the GenApplication object, the GenText's status would be wiped out by the subsequent reporting by the process text object.

Undo Mechanism</H2>
<P>
<A NAME="GenProcess_2.htm_IX_Undo">
 </A>
<A NAME="GenProcess_2.htm_IX_Clipboard:undo chains">
 </A>
The Undo mechanism is implemented at the GenProcess level; this allows the undo mechanism to be applicable to any application or process. In general, Undo allows a process, usually within an application, but possibly within a library, to reverse changes made in the state of other objects. GEOS allows an almost unlimited number of stored and reversible Undo actions; the practical limit is somewhere around 100 actions.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="GenProcess_2.htm_IX_AddUndoActionStruct">
 </A>
<A NAME="GenProcess_2.htm_IX_AUAS_&ldots;">
 </A>
Undo actions are stored within undo <EM>
chains</EM>
. These chains allow queued actions to be undone in reverse order. Each element in an undo chain is made up of an <CODE>
UndoActionStruct</CODE>
. These structures are usually added with an <CODE>
AddUndoActionStruct</CODE>
. This structure has several elements:</P>
<PRE>typedef struct {
	UndoActionStruct				AUAS_data;
	optr				AUAS_output;
	AddUndoActionFlags				AUAS_flags;
} AddUndoActionStruct</PRE>
<P>
A chain of undo actions is stored for each object. If you want your object to recognize undo-able actions, you must add the undo actions yourself and intercept MSG_META_UNDO when those actions are played back. The object should be able to understand the data within the <CODE>
UndoActionStruct</CODE>
 to perform the Undo action.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="GenProcess_2.htm_IX_AddUndoActionFlags">
 </A>
<A NAME="GenProcess_2.htm_IX_AUAF_&ldots;">
 </A>
There are two <CODE>
AddUndoActionFlags</CODE>
 which affect when and how undo notification occurs. If AUAF_NOTIFY_BEFORE_FREEING or AUAF_NOTIFY_IF_FREED_WITHOUT_BEING_PLAYED_BACK is set in the <CODE>
AddUndoActionFlags</CODE>
, it not only receives MSG_META_UNDO but also receives MSG_META_UNDO_FREEING_ACTION when the undo mechanism frees the action. You can check the flags in the <CODE>
AddUndoActionStruct</CODE>
 passed with this message to decide what action to take.</P>
<P>
The object wishing to register an action for undo sends the process MSG_GEN_PROCESS_UNDO_START_CHAIN. For each action in this undo chain (there may be multiple actions in a single chain) send MSG_GEN_PROCESS_UNDO_ADD_ACTION; pass this message the <CODE>
AddUndoActionStruct</CODE>
 action of the action to add. Finally, send MSG_GEN_PROCESS_UNDO_END_CHAIN to mark the end of this undo chain. Undo chains may be nested within each other.</P>
<P>
The messages following this section also describe supplemental behavior that you may find useful. In addition to these messages, <CODE>
GenProcessClass</CODE>
 also provides the following routines:</P>
<P>
<CODE>
GenProcessUndoGetFile() </CODE>
returns a file handle of a Huge Array or DB item to hold undo information. Use this routine to get a file to put such undo information into.</P>
<P>
<CODE>
GenProcessUndoCheckIfIgnoring()</CODE>
 allows an application or library to check whether an application is ignoring undo information; in this case, it can avoid creating unnecessary undo information.</P>

Undo Mechanism</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="GenProcess_3.htm_IX_Undo">
 </A>
<A NAME="GenProcess_3.htm_IX_Clipboard:undo chains">
 </A>
The Undo mechanism is implemented at the GenProcess level; this allows the undo mechanism to be applicable to any application or process. In general, Undo allows a process, usually within an application, but possibly within a library, to reverse changes made in the state of other objects. GEOS allows an almost unlimited number of stored and reversible Undo actions; the practical limit is somewhere around 100 actions.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="GenProcess_3.htm_IX_AddUndoActionStruct">
 </A>
<A NAME="GenProcess_3.htm_IX_AUAS_&ldots;">
 </A>
Undo actions are stored within undo <EM>
chains</EM>
. These chains allow queued actions to be undone in reverse order. Each element in an undo chain is made up of an <CODE>
UndoActionStruct</CODE>
. These structures are usually added with an <CODE>
AddUndoActionStruct</CODE>
. This structure has several elements:</P>
<PRE>typedef struct {
	UndoActionStruct				AUAS_data;
	optr				AUAS_output;
	AddUndoActionFlags				AUAS_flags;
} AddUndoActionStruct</PRE>
<P>
A chain of undo actions is stored for each object. If you want your object to recognize undo-able actions, you must add the undo actions yourself and intercept MSG_META_UNDO when those actions are played back. The object should be able to understand the data within the <CODE>
UndoActionStruct</CODE>
 to perform the Undo action.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="GenProcess_3.htm_IX_AddUndoActionFlags">
 </A>
<A NAME="GenProcess_3.htm_IX_AUAF_&ldots;">
 </A>
There are two <CODE>
AddUndoActionFlags</CODE>
 which affect when and how undo notification occurs. If AUAF_NOTIFY_BEFORE_FREEING or AUAF_NOTIFY_IF_FREED_WITHOUT_BEING_PLAYED_BACK is set in the <CODE>
AddUndoActionFlags</CODE>
, it not only receives MSG_META_UNDO but also receives MSG_META_UNDO_FREEING_ACTION when the undo mechanism frees the action. You can check the flags in the <CODE>
AddUndoActionStruct</CODE>
 passed with this message to decide what action to take.</P>
<P>
The object wishing to register an action for undo sends the process MSG_GEN_PROCESS_UNDO_START_CHAIN. For each action in this undo chain (there may be multiple actions in a single chain) send MSG_GEN_PROCESS_UNDO_ADD_ACTION; pass this message the <CODE>
AddUndoActionStruct</CODE>
 action of the action to add. Finally, send MSG_GEN_PROCESS_UNDO_END_CHAIN to mark the end of this undo chain. Undo chains may be nested within each other.</P>
<P>
The messages following this section also describe supplemental behavior that you may find useful. In addition to these messages, <CODE>
GenProcessClass</CODE>
 also provides the following routines:</P>
<P>
<CODE>
GenProcessUndoGetFile() </CODE>
returns a file handle of a Huge Array or DB item to hold undo information. Use this routine to get a file to put such undo information into.</P>
<P>
<CODE>
GenProcessUndoCheckIfIgnoring()</CODE>
 allows an application or library to check whether an application is ignoring undo information; in this case, it can avoid creating unnecessary undo information.</P>
