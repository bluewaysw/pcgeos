Input

</H1>
<P>
Nearly all applications will in some way handle user input. User input can come from a keyboard, a mouse, or a stylus. (Other types of input are generally considered data input.) For the most part, GEOS hides the actual mechanics of input from the application; at the same time, it allows extreme flexibility of input handling.</P>
<P>
Input to generic UI objects is handled by these objects--unless you have very specific needs and will subclass a generic gadget, you can leave its input handling up to GEOS. The same is true with most specialized system-provided objects such as the GrObj, the VisText, the Spreadsheet, and others. Other objects (such as basic visible objects you subclass yourself) will need more attention depending on the behavior you want them to have.</P>
<P>
Read this chapter if your application will handle user input. Before reading this chapter, however, you should be relatively familiar with the GEOS system architecture, Goc syntax, and the GEOS object model and message passing. It is also suggested that you spend some time programming with generic and visible objects and getting used to the rest of the system before handling input events.</P>

<A HREF="#index.htm">Input</A>: 1 
Input Flow</H2>
<P>
User input must flow in an orderly way from the user's device to the proper GEOS object. In a multithreaded environment, just determining the appropriate input recipient can be a monumental task.</P>
<P>
GEOS uses several layers of indirection to process user input and to distribute it to its proper destination so applications don't have to. The scheme used not only isolates applications from dealing with devices directly, but it provides convenient and easy ways to control input flow, both within an application and throughout the entire system.</P>
<P>
The figure below shows the flow of input from the user's device to its destination. User input is managed primarily by device drivers acting in concert with the UI, and several threads are involved in the input flow. For example, the kernel provides a thread solely for input management that has a high priority; this insures that the pointer image always moves immediately with the mouse.</P>
<P>
Input is registered by a device such as a keyboard, stylus, or mouse. The device sends signals to GEOS device drivers, which take the signals and translate them into raw input messages the UI understands. These raw messages are translated by the UI's Input Manager, which refines the events even further. The Input Manager then sends the events on to the topmost UI object in the system, the GenSystem object.
<IMG SRC="Input_1_flow.gif">

</P>
<P>
The GenSystem examines the events and their contexts and determines which window or application should receive them. Typically, events you will be interested in will flow from the GenSystem through your GenApplication object, its GenPrimary window, and finally through the appropriate GenView or GenDisplay. These window objects will pass the event on to a visible tree (through a VisContent), which will handle the events.</P>
<P>
It is highly unlikely you will ever need to know anything about an input event before it gets to your GenApplication object. Typically, you will only handle mouse, pen, or Keyboard events in custom visible objects and can ignore them in all other cases.</P>
<P>
Input events take the form of standard GEOS messages. These messages are defined by the UI but are actually part of <CODE>
MetaClass</CODE>
 (they are allocated in <CODE>
MetaClass</CODE>
 and exported to the UI). The reference entries for these events can therefore be found under <CODE>
MetaClass</CODE>

</P>
<P>
Input events give information about the type of event (e.g., a mouse event), the action taking place (e.g., the right mouse button was pressed), and additional information (e.g., the location of the mouse at the time). Each device has its own set of events--for example, keyboard presses induce <CODE>
MSG_META_KBD_CHAR</CODE>
, and mouse moves induce <CODE>
MSG_META_MOUSE_PTR</CODE>
.</P>

<A HREF="#index.htm">Input</A>: 1.1 <A HREF="#Input_1.htm">Input Flow</A>: 
Devices and Drivers</H3>
<P>
GEOS supports a number of input devices through the use of device drivers. The basic GEOS system software supports mouse, keyboard, and stylus input. Other input devices may be supported by the system software in the future by the addition of new device drivers. Other devices may provide data input in one form or another--a scanner, for example--but these devices are not considered <EM>
user</EM>
 input devices. These are considered <EM>
data</EM>
 input devices and do not generate input events through the Input Manager.</P>
<P>
The use of device drivers isolates your application and libraries from the specifics of the user's machine. GEOS includes drivers for most mice and keyboards (pen input uses a derivative of the mouse drivers), and drivers for new hardware may be added without requiring changes to your application.</P>
<P>
A device driver takes raw input signals from the input device and translates it into raw input events that the Input Manager will understand. Your objects will never receive these events; they are only sent to the Input Manager for translation into pointer, button, or Keyboard events.</P>

Input Manager and GenSystem</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="Input_3.htm_IX_Input manager">
 </A>
The Input Manager is part of the User Interface and primarily assesses input events in the context of the system. It takes a raw input event from the device driver, passes it through various pre-set monitors (for the UI), and then adds contextual information if necessary. The Input Manager passes the refined input event on to the topmost system object, the GenSystem object.</P>
<P>
The GenSystem object determines where the event should be passed. Typically, it will send the event on to whichever application is designated as the active application.</P>

<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">Input</A>: 1.3 <A HREF="#Input_1.htm">Input Flow</A>: 
Input Events</H3>
<P>
GEOS uses three basic types of input events. These three types make up all the events necessary for mouse, keyboard, and pen input. They are <EM>
Pointer events</EM>
, <EM>
Button events</EM>
, and <EM>
Keyboard events</EM>
.</P>
<P>
Pointer and Button events deal with mouse and pen input. Keyboard events provide keyboard key press information. Pointer and Button events are often referred to as &quot;mouse&quot; events and are dealt with together because most objects interested in one type will also be interested in the other.</P>
<P>
A Pointer event details motion of the mouse pointer. If the user moves the mouse, a <CODE>
MSG_META_MOUSE_PTR</CODE>
 will be generated by the Input Manager and sent to the proper application. The type of Pointer event (not always <CODE>
MSG_META_MOUSE_PTR</CODE>
) is affected by the current keyboard state, mouse state, and other context information.</P>
<P>
A Button event details the press or release of a particular mouse button. Because different Specific UIs have different meanings for each mouse button, the function of the button determines which message is sent out. In the OSF/Motif specific UI, the left mouse button is used for selection; therefore, presses on that button cause <CODE>
MSG_META_START_SELECT</CODE>
, and releases cause <CODE>
MSG_META_END_SELECT</CODE>
. The exact message sent out, like Pointer events, can also be affected by input state information.</P>
<P>
Mouse events also carry with them several flags indicating various statistics about the event: whether the click is actually a double-click, whether any keys on the keyboard are being held down, etc.</P>
<P>
A Keyboard event details the press or release of a particular key on the user's keyboard. Usually, objects interested in Keyboard events will only be interested in presses and can ignore releases. <CODE>
MSG_META_KBD_CHAR</CODE>
 is the basic Keyboard event, and it carries flags detailing the state of the various modifier keys (e.g., Shift, Ctrl, Alt, NumLock). This message is always sent to the current focus.</P>
<P>
Pen input comes in the form of a special data structure called <CODE>
Ink</CODE>
. Ink input is instigated in the same manner as Button events, but it is handled in a completely separate manner. An object expecting Ink input must be aware when Ink events are being passed as opposed to normal mouse events. Special flags are used for this; see <A HREF="#Input_e.htm_16857"> Pen Input and Ink</A>
.</P>

<A NAME="Input_5.htm"></A>


<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">Input</A>: 1.4 <A HREF="#Input_1.htm">Input Flow</A>: 
Input Hierarchies</H3>
<P>
Because the entire User Interface of GEOS is implemented as a hierarchy (tree) of objects, input messages naturally flow from the topmost object in the tree down to the object that should receive the input. At each level in the tree, the object decides whether to handle the event or pass it on to one of its children. Typically, the event will be passed all the way down the tree to a leaf node, where it will be handled or ignored.</P>
<P>
To simplify and shorten this process, the UI maintains several special hierarchical input flow channels where special input should always flow. These hierarchies include the <EM>
focus</EM>
, the <EM>
target</EM>
, and the <EM>
model</EM>
. All three are described in full in <A HREF="#Input_11.htm_95885"> Input Hierarchies</A>
.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Input_5.htm_IX_Focus">
 </A>
The Focus is the object that should receive all Keyboard events. For example, a modal dialog box always has the focus; if the user presses Enter, the dialog box will take its default action. A text object into which the user is typing has the focus as long as the user does not click outside its bounds.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Input_5.htm_IX_Target">
 </A>
The Target is what is selected by the user: the object on which actions should be performed. Controller objects (of <CODE>
GenControlClass</CODE>
) typically operate on the target. An example is a text object with selected text. When you set the text's style using a menu item (a style control object), that menu item sends its message to the current target object. The text object, set as the current Target, receives the message and sets the style of the selection.</P>
<P>
An object is said to &quot;have the focus&quot; or &quot;have the target&quot; if it is the object specified by the hierarchy to receive that type of input. The system provides special <EM>
travel options</EM>
 to allow you to send messages directly to the focus or target without knowing in advance which object is the destination.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Input_5.htm_IX_Model">
 </A>
The Model represents the non-visible model of the application's data. For example, a secondary selection in a database will not be acted on like the normal target, but it may still need to have similar properties. The Model hierarchy can be used to maintain this type of secondary or non-visible selection.</P>

<H2 CLASS="sectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">Input</A>: 2 
Mouse Input</H2>
<P>
GEOS<A NAME="Input_6.htm_IX_Mouse">
 </A>
 is built around the user's use of a mouse for most input. Although the system has extensive keyboard navigation capabilities, the mouse is still the preferred input tool for a GUI. Therefore, most applications will in some way accept and handle mouse input directly.</P>
<P>
Typically, you will handle mouse input if you are using visible objects (<CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
, etc.) that will react to the mouse. If you are using only generic objects in your application, you will not need to handle mouse events.</P>
<P>
Mouse input comes in the form of pointer and Button events. Each event describes the mouse's location, the type of event (move, button press, etc.), whether any buttons on the mouse are pressed, and whether any modifier keys on the keyboard are pressed.</P>
<P>
Objects can &quot;grab&quot; the mouse exclusive, taking all mouse events for themselves. This is useful when one object needs to get all mouse input for a period of time; when it no longer needs all mouse input, it releases the exclusive. Mouse events are dispatched directly to whichever object has the &quot;active grab&quot; (the exclusive).</P>
<P>
If no object has the active grab, the event will be passed to the application under the pointer. The application will pass the event to the window or GenView under the pointer, and the window or view will pass it to its content. If the view displays a visible tree, the event will eventually reach the visible object under the mouse pointer, where it should be handled. Thus, the object under the mouse pointer is said to have the &quot;implied grab.&quot;</P>
<P>
The default behavior of the VisContent (passing the event to its first child with the appropriate bounds) is adequate for most input needs. If you are using large documents or visible layers, you will have to subclass the VisContent to handle these special cases.</P>

<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">Input</A>: 2.1 <A HREF="#Input_6.htm">Mouse Input</A>: 
Mouse Events</H3>
<P>
Each time the user moves the mouse or clicks a mouse button, GEOS generates a mouse event and passes it to the proper object. Mouse events are actually <CODE>
MetaClass</CODE>
 messages that any object may intercept. Default handlers for these messages typically do nothing, so if you do not handle a particular event, it will likely be ignored.</P>
<P>
GEOS uses three basic types of mouse events: button, pointer, and drag events. Button events indicate when the user has either pressed or released any mouse button (double-clicks are considered Button events). Pointer events indicate that the mouse has been moved. Drag events indicate the user has clicked and dragged the mouse. All of these types pass information about the mouse context and the operations currently in progress.</P>
<P>
The Input Manager checks both the button state and the mouse movement before deciding on an event's type. For example, ifthe user clicks twice quickly, the Input Manager decides whether the user intended a double-click or a click-move-click. Objects receiving the events do not have to differentiate between the two; the events automatically contain the required information.</P>
<P>
Pointer events are fairly straightforward; when the mouse is moved, the Input Manager generates the proper <CODE>
MSG_META_MOUSE_PTR</CODE>
 indicating the move. This message also indicates the state of the mouse buttons and keyboard modifier keys.</P>
<P>
Button events are quite a bit more complex. With each button press or release, the Input Manager generates a <CODE>
MSG_META_MOUSE_BUTTON</CODE>
 which gets translated into the proper press/release/drag event before being passed on to the application. The final message generated depends on which button was pressed, whether large graphics coordinates are being used, and whether the event is being sent pre-passive or post-passive.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Input_7.htm_IX_MSG_META_START_&ldots;">
 </A>
Among Button events, there are two basic types: the press and the release. All press events are of the form <CODE>
MSG_META_START_...</CODE>
, <A NAME="Input_7.htm_IX_MSG_META_END_&ldots;">
 </A>
and all release events are of the form <CODE>
MSG_META_END_...</CODE>
. The last portion of the message name is the function of the button pressed or released. The various buttons are referred to by their meaning to the Specific UI, as follows:</P>

 </A>
<A NAME="Input_7.htm_IX_MSG_META_DRAG_&ldots;">
 </A>
<CODE>
SELECT</CODE>
</DT><DD>The button used for making selections. In OSF/Motif and many other Specific UIs, this is the left mouse button.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
MOVE_COPY</CODE>
</DT><DD>The button used for quick-copies and quick-moves of data. In OSF/Motif, this is the right mouse button. For single-button mice, a key sequence plus a mouse click is often used.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
FEATURES</CODE>
</DT><DD>The button used to bring up a &quot;features&quot; pop-up menu or dialog box. In some Specific UIs, this is the middle or the right mouse button. For single- or two-button mice, a key sequence plus a mouse click is often used.</DD>
<DT>
<CODE>
OTHER</CODE>
</DT><DD>Any button not designated one of the three categories above. This category can also be used to indicate when the user presses more than one button at a time.</DD>
</DL>
<P>
A press event indicates the user pressed down on the particular button. A release event indicates the user released the button. If the user presses a button and moves the mouse, a drag event will be sent after the initial press event. If the user double-clicks, a special flag will be sent with a single press event; it is up to the application to handle double-clicks differently.</P>
<P>
Drag events are of the form <CODE>
MSG_META_DRAG_...</CODE>
, similar to Button events. Each of the above button types has a corresponding drag message. If the user presses a mouse button and quickly moves the mouse more than a specified distance, or if he holds a particular mouse button down more than a specified time, the Input Manager will send a drag event after the press event. A single release event signifies the user released the mouse button, just as with normal presses.</P>
<P>
There is also a complete set of events used for large documents. If an object has large bounds, or if a GenView is set up to display a large content, large mouse events will be generated instead of normal mouse events. Large events take the form <CODE>
MSG_META_LARGE_...</CODE>
. For example, the large version of <CODE>
MSG_META_MOUSE_PTR</CODE>
 is <CODE>
MSG_META_LARGE_PTR</CODE>

<A NAME="Input_8.htm_IX_Mouse:grabbing">

When no object has the active mouse grab, mouse events are passed to whichever object is directly under the pointer's image. If any object has the grab, however, mouse events will be passed only to the object with the grab, no matter where the pointer is on the screen.</P>
<P>
When the user clicks inside a view, the GenView automatically grabs the mouse while the user holds the mouse button down. This allows the view to know when drag scrolling takes place (the user drags the pointer outside the view's bounds, but the mouse event is still passed to the GenView). Process objects acting as a GenView's content therefore do not have to worry about grabbing the mouse. If you are displaying visible objects within the GenView, however, your objects will likely want to grab the mouse for themselves.</P>

Typically, a visible object will grab the mouse on a <CODE>

 event and release it on a <CODE>

There are two other types of mouse grabs besides the active grab. With very rare exceptions, application programmers can ignore these. They are the pre-passive and post-passive grabs.

If an object has a pre-passive grab, it will receive copies of all Button events before the events are passed on to their true destinations.

The GEOS User Interface uses several default settings for the mouse pointer, all defined by the Specific UI. </P>

Some applications will want to modify the mouse pointer's image in order to provide certain feedback to the user. For example, a chess game may set the pointer to an image of the piece being moved and then reset it to an arrow after the move is completed; a graphics application could set the pointer to an image of whatever tool is currently in use. Another time an application may change the mouse pointer is when a quick-transfer is in progress.</P>

Defining the Pointer Image</H4>
<P>
The pointer is defined as a bitmap 16 pixels on each side.<A NAME="Input_a.htm_IX_Hot spot (mouse pointer)">

<P>
<A NAME="Input_a.htm_IX_PointerDef">
 </A>
The pointer is stored in a <CODE>
PointerDef16</CODE>
 structure. This structure defines the image bitmap, the horizontal and vertical offsets to the hot spot, and the definition of how the image should mix with the background. This definition is known as the pointer's mask.</P>
<P>
The definition of <CODE>
PointerDef16</CODE>
 is given below. When setting the pointer image, you will typically pass an optr (a combination handle and chunk handle) to a <CODE>
PointerDef16</CODE>
 structure; the structure can be set up in a sharable chunk beforehand, or it can be set in a local or global variable. Typically, you will set the entire pointer image in a resource chunk and compile it into your geode; this is much easier and faster to use than building it at run-time.</P>

<P>
The <CODE>
PD_hotX</CODE>
 field defines the horizontal offset from the upper-left corner of the image to the center of the hot spot. Similarly, <CODE>
PD_hotY</CODE>

Setting the Pointer Image</H4>

You can set the pointer's image in three ways. First, you can send a message to the GenView to set the pointer image whenever the pointer is over the view's window (see <A HREF="../../UI/GenView/combo.htm">the GenView chapter</A>). Second, you can set the pointer to a default image type during a quick-transfer operation (see <A HREF="../../SysObjects/Clipboard/combo.htm">the Clipboard chapter</A>). Third, you can set the pointer image after handling a mouse event. Only the third option is discussed here.</P><P>
An object may wish to set the pointer image while it is selected, while the pointer is over its bounds, or in any number of other situations. For example, a chess piece currently being moved may set the pointer's image to the shape of the piece so the user knows exactly what type of piece is being moved.</P>
<P>
Every mouse event you handle must return a <CODE>
MouseReturnParams</CODE>

<UL>

Keyboard Input</H2>
<P>

 </A>
Keyboard input is scanned by a device driver and passed on to the Input Manager, just as mouse input is. The keyboard driver and Input Manager check the state of the modifier keys (Shift, Ctrl, Alt, Num Lock, etc.) and parse each keypress as much as possible based on its context. Each keypress is called a <EM>
Keyboard event</EM>
 and is passed in <CODE>
MSG_META_KBD_CHAR</CODE>
.</P>

<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">Input</A>: 3.1 <A HREF="#Input_b.htm">Keyboard Input</A>: 
Keyboard Input Flow</H3>
<P>
Each time the user presses a character (with or without modifier keys) on the keyboard, the Input Manager generates a single Keyboard event and passes it to the GenSystem object. The GenSystem object delivers the event to all the proper objects based on passive grabs (if any) and the current focus hierarchy.</P>
<P>
As with mouse events, all Keyboard events are passed down the object hierarchy from the GenSystem object through an application's GenApplication object and on down to a leaf object. When handling keyboard input, you can choose to intercept the events at the GenApplication level or at any node below it where the event should be handled.</P>
<P>
Unlike with mouse input, there is no &quot;implied grab&quot; for keyboard input. Keyboard input is always passed to the object that has the focus (for information on the Focus hierarchy, see <A HREF="#Input_14.htm_53863"> Using Focus</A>
). Therefore the focus is the keyboard's &quot;active grab.&quot;</P>
<P>
Objects can, however, set up passive grabs as they can with mouse input. A pre-passive grab allows the visible object to receive Keyboard events before the focus object gets them. A post-passive grab delivers events to the visible object after they have been sent to the focus. For more information about gaining and releasing the passive keyboard grabs, see <A HREF="../../UI/VisClass/combo.htm">the VisClass chapter</A>.</P><P>
If you intercept Keyboard events, you must be sure to return any events that you don't use. For example, if you only want to detect when the user hits the &quot;a&quot; key, you must return all keypresses that are not &quot;a.&quot; Otherwise, your <CODE>
MSG_META_KBD_CHAR</CODE>
 handler will eat all keypresses, and keyboard menu navigation will not work. If intercepting Keyboard events in a generic object, you can simply call the superclass for each unused character. If intercepting Keyboard events in a visible object, you must send <CODE>
MSG_META_FUP_KBD_CHAR</CODE>
 for each unused character.</P>
<P>
To ensure that a particular object (for example, a specific GenText object) automatically will receive keyboard input, you must set <CODE>
HINT_DEFAULT_FOCUS</CODE>
 for that object and all its parents up to the GenPrimary containing it. Otherwise, the generic UI does not know which object should gain the default focus.</P>

<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">Input</A>: 3.2 <A HREF="#Input_b.htm">Keyboard Input</A>: 
Keyboard Events</H3>
<P>
Each Keyboard event your application and objects receive has gone through preliminary parsing by the keyboard driver. Keyboard drivers are intelligent enough to know several things about different types of keystrokes depending on the character set and the modifier keys held down.</P>
<P>
All Keyboard events pass two sets of information: the current character as interpreted by the keyboard driver, and the actual scan code of the character pressed. This allows you to do additional parsing or to ignore any extraneous information about the keypress that may have been included by the driver.</P>
<P>
For example, if the user presses <CODE>
Ctrl-1</CODE>
, the keyboard driver passes on the character &quot;1&quot; with a flag indicating the Ctrl key was pressed. If the user presses <CODE>
Shift-1</CODE>
, the keyboard driver passes on the &quot;!&quot; character <EM>
without</EM>
 a flag indicating the Shift key is pressed (the Shift key is eaten by the keyboard driver); in this case, it also passes on the scan code of the &quot;1&quot; key. If the user then presses <CODE>
Ctrl-Shift-1</CODE>
, different keyboard drivers may pass different characters. Whether the driver passes &quot;1&quot; or &quot;!,&quot; however, the scan code for the &quot;1&quot; key will also be passed.</P>
<P>
The keyboard driver also understands special &quot;extended&quot; keypresses and &quot;temporary accents&quot;. Some keyboard drivers may use two keystrokes to specify special characters; for example, some keyboard drivers may require the � character to be entered as &quot;Ctrl-q o&quot; (this is called an extended keypress), and some may require it to be entered as two separate keys: the &quot;o&quot; and the umlaut (this is called a temporary accent).</P>
<P>
In addition to the actual character and the scan code, every Keyboard event gives flags indicating the state of the modifier keys (Ctrl, Alt, Shift), the state of the toggle keys (Caps Lock, Num Lock, etc.), and what type of event it is (first press, repeated press, release, or first press of an extended sequence).</P>

 supports pen-based systems and applications by means of the Ink data structure formats. Ink is simply a standard way of representing raw pen input as a data structure.</P>
<P>
At the lowest level, individual visible objects can receive Ink input directly, much like they receive mouse input normally. (In addition, the VisText object has some Ink handling and handwriting recognition built into it.)</P>
<P>
The Pen Library exports InkClass, a visible object class which accepts and stores pen input. It stores the ink compactly. The ink object allows the pen to act as an eraser, removing part or all of a pen stroke, perhaps splitting some strokes in two. See <A HREF="../../UI/Pen/combo.htm">the Pen Object Library chapter</A> for more information.</P>
<P>
If GEOS is running on a pen-based system, it will set a particular flag in its private data. It will also install a special input monitor to alter the events the Input Manager receives from the device driver. The Input Manager and the UI then react to input events in a different manner and do not send them directly as with mouse events.</P>
<P>
Because Ink events are not passed on immediately by the UI, the UI actually takes care of drawing them directly to the screen. This provides the user direct, immediate feedback.</P>

When the Input Manager receives a Button event, it checks to see if that event should be treated as Ink input. It first holds up input, putting the Button event in the holdup queue, and then it queries the appropriate application with <CODE>

Some objects may want both Ink and mouse input; the VisText object is a good example of this--it accepts Ink for handwriting recognition and mouse events for cursor movement and text selection.

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Controlling the Ink</H4>
<P>
When an object requests Ink input by returning IRV_DESIRES_INK or IRV_INK_WITH_STANDARD_OVERRIDE, it must also specify the eventual destination of the Ink data block. Additionally, it can set any characteristics in a GState for the Ink--clipping area, drawing color, etc.</P>

 structure set up by your <CODE>

<P>
If you choose not to set any of these specifics, Ink will have the following default behaviors:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The destination of the Ink will be the object that would have received the initial click event (typically the implied mouse grab) or the object that fielded the <CODE>

<LI>
The Ink will not be clipped; the user may draw over the entire screen, overlapping generic objects and other windows. (All the Ink will still be sent to the same destination, however.)</LI>

How Ink Is Stored and Passed On</H4>
<P>
When the user presses the pen to the screen and the input is determined to be Ink, the Input Manager generates a mouse button press event and begins storing up the subsequent mouse events. The UI then determines whether that press event should be treated as Ink or not (the default behavior is to treat them as normal mouse events).</P>
<P>
If the events should not be treated as Ink, they are passed on as normal mouse events. If they are to be treated as Ink, they are stored and are <EM>
not</EM>
 passed on. Instead, the UI stores them up in a special data block until the Ink input is stopped. Ink input is stopped when the user removes the pen from the screen for a user-specified amount of time. This amount of time is specified in the GEOS.INI file in the [system] category under the key <EM>
inkTimeout</EM>
. </P>
<P>
<A NAME="Input_10.htm_IX_MSG_VIS_QUERY_IF_OBJECT_HANDLES_INK">
 </A>
After the user finishes entering the Ink input, the Input Manager determines which object will receive the data block (it may not be the original object that received the initial press). It first queries the original object with <CODE>
MSG_VIS_QUERY_IF_OBJECT_HANDLES_INK</CODE>
. Any object handling Ink input must subclass this message and make sure that the top Ink point is not above its upper bound; it should then return its upper bound and its optr. GEOS provides a routine that does just this; if your object will always handle Ink input, you can set this routine up as the method to be used as follows:</P>
<PRE>@method VisObjectHandlesInkReply, YourClassName,
                MSG_VIS_QUERY_IF_OBJECT_HANDLES_INK;</PRE>

If the object handles Ink, the Input Manager sends the entire data block off to the GenSystem object using <CODE>
MSG_META_NOTIFY_WITH_DATA_BLOCK</CODE>
 with the identifier NT_INK. (For information on this and other notification messages, see <A HREF="../../Kernel/GCN/combo.htm">the General Change Notification chapter</A>.)</P>

Input Hierarchies</H2>
<P>
As previously mentioned in this chapter, the Input Manager channels input events to particular objects. The objects are chosen based on the current input grabs, the position of the pointer, and the state of the application. Sometimes, though, input events must be sent to a particular object not specified by one of these means. One example is keyboard input: While an object can grab the keyboard exclusive, it should not; instead, it should make itself the <EM>
focus</EM>
. The object that has the focus receives all keyboard input (<CODE>
MSG_META_KBD_CHAR</CODE>
).</P>
<P>
Similarly, your application or other objects may need to send messages to the object which is currently active. For example, a Text Sizes menu may need to know which of several text objects currently has an active selection. Then, when the user selects a new text size, the menu can send its message to the proper text object. The object that receives these messages is called the <EM>
target</EM>
 object.</P>
<P>
The menu in this case, however, should not have to explicitly name the destination of its message. The menu should be able to specify that its message should go to the current target object; the UI knows which object is the target, and it redirects the message automatically.</P>
<P>
The GEOS UI uses three special hierarchical mechanisms to fulfill these two purposes (specialized input flow and specification of destinations). These hierarchical mechanisms are built into the basic structure of GEOS objects and are therefore universal and consistent for all applications and all objects. The three hierarchies used are the <EM>
focus</EM>
, the <EM>
target</EM>
, and the <EM>
model</EM>
. (There is a fourth, the controller, but it is used only internally by GEOS.) These hierarchies all function in the same manner but are used for different purposes.</P>

<A HREF="#index.htm">Input</A>: 5.1 <A HREF="#Input_11.htm">Input Hierarchies</A>: 
The Three Hierarchies</H3>
<P>
As stated above, GEOS offers three hierarchies you can use for input flow and specification of message destinations. These hierarchies, with their basic purposes, are listed below.</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Focus<BR>
The Focus hierarchy designates which object should currently receive keyboard input. Essentially, the focus object has the active keyboard grab. The text objects (VisText and GenText) manage the focus automatically; if you use only these objects for keyboard input, you will not need to understand the focus. The Focus hierarchy is described in full in <A HREF="#Input_14.htm_53863"> Using Focus</A>
.</LI>
<LI>
Target<BR>
The Target hierarchy designates the active view, window, and visible selection which may be acted upon. In most cases, the target will be an object the user has selected and now wishes to alter based on menu and dialog selections. For example, a graphic object selected becomes the target object of the application; when the user selects &quot;Rotate&quot; or some other menu function, the menu sends its message to the selected object via the target hierarchy. The Target hierarchy is described in full in <A HREF="#Input_15.htm_74791"> Using Target</A>
.</LI>
<LI>
Model<BR>
The Model hierarchy designates the model of the data the user can manipulate. This is provided for highly complex applications that need to extend the Target hierarchy for more specific handling of selections. It extends from the GenSystem through the GenApplication and the document control objects. The Model hierarchy is described in full in <A HREF="#Input_16.htm_76447"> Using Model</A>
.</LI>
</UL>
<HR>
<A NAME="Input_13.htm"></A>


<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">Input</A>: 5.2 <A HREF="#Input_11.htm">Input Hierarchies</A>: 
Common Hierarchy Basics</H3>
<P>
All three of the input hierarchies function in a similar manner. Each relies on the basic tree structure of UI objects to build a path from the topmost system UI object (GenSystem) down to a leaf node that has the hierarchical properties (e.g., the target object).</P>
<P>
Each composite object can have exactly one child with each hierarchical property. The composite determines which of its children currently has the <EM>
exclusive</EM>
 of the hierarchy; for example, a composite with ten children may designate the fourth child as the Target node at its level. If that child is a composite with its own children, it will select one of them as the Target node at the next level.

</P>
<P>
A message sent to any object in the path will be passed down the tree until it gets to the active target leaf, the object that actually has the system's target exclusive.</P>
<P>
A special feature of the hierarchical structure is that inactive paths may be maintained. The inactive path is stored in the objects themselves. The topmost object in the tree, however, has decided that object on the right has the target exclusive; if later the top object decides the object on the left has the exclusive, the target will automatically be given to the leaf node specified without actually changing the object tree (just the pointer stored in the top node).</P>
<P>
Note that the other hierarchies operate in a similar manner. The behavior described is not unique to the target hierarchy.</P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Special Terminology</H4>
<P>
Before reading the in-depth sections on the individual hierarchies, you should know how several terms are defined and used. These terms are listed below.</P>
<DL>
<DT>
<EM>
Node</EM>
</DT><DD>Any composite in the object tree that can be part of a path for one of the hierarchies.</DD>
<DT>
<EM>
Exclusive</EM>
</DT><DD>The active child of a composite node in the hierarchy is said to have the &quot;exclusive.&quot; Only one child of any composite may have the exclusive at that level.</DD>
<DT>
<EM>
Level</EM>
</DT><DD>A group of siblings, all of which can potentially be part of a hierarchical path. All the nodes in a given level will have the same parent. Only one node at each level may have the exclusive for that level.</DD>
<DT>
<EM>
Grab</EM>
</DT><DD>When an object grabs a hierarchy (e.g., &quot;grabs the focus&quot;), it notifies its parent that it wants to gain that hierarchy's exclusive for its level. Any other node at the same level will be forced to give up the exclusive.</DD>
<DT>
<EM>
Active Path</DT><DD>
</EM>
The path of exclusive nodes from the top object to the leaf having the active exclusive. Only objects which have a complete active path to the top node can exhibit the property of the hierarchy (e.g., a text object in a minimized application can not have the focus because its primary window does not have the focus exclusive).</DD>
<DT>
<EM>
Inactive Path</DT><DD>
</EM>
Any path of exclusive nodes that is broken from the top node. If the topmost node of an inactive path is given the exclusive at its level, the entire inactive path will automatically become the active path.
<IMG SRC="Input_13_terminology.gif">

</DD>


</DL>
<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Modifying the Active Path</H4>
<P>
Each of the three hierarchies has messages understood by <CODE>
MetaClass</CODE>
 that alter the hierarchy's active path. The Specific UI takes care of most of the modifications to the active path, however, so simple applications will not need to bother with it.</P>
<P>
Any node can &quot;grab&quot; a hierarchical exclusive by sending the grab message to its parent. (Outside agents can alter the path by sending the grab message to the child's parent on behalf of the child.) The grab forces any other node on the child's level to give up the exclusive. Any node can release the exclusive with the appropriate message (typically done when forced to release because of another node's grab).</P>
<P>
Whenever a node gains the exclusive of a hierarchy, it will be notified via a message. This is to notify objects which already had their level's exclusive that they now have the active hierarchical exclusive. Similarly, if another node grabs the exclusive at any level equal or above an exclusive node, that node will be notified that it has lost the exclusive at its level. See the discussions of the individual hierarchies for more detail on the messages used.</P>

<LI>
Application-direct<BR>
The &quot;application-direct&quot; travel options are TO_APP_FOCUS, TO_APP_TARGET, and TO_APP_MODEL. These send the classed event first to the GenApplication object associated with the recipient of <CODE>
MSG_META_SEND_CLASSED_EVENT</CODE>

<LI>
System-direct<BR>
The &quot;system-direct&quot; travel options are TO_SYS_FOCUS, TO_SYS_TARGET, and TO_SYS_MODEL. These send the classed event to the GenSystem object, the topmost object in the entire UI object tree.

Using Focus</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="Input_14.htm_IX_Focus">

The specific UI handles most of the manipulation of the focus hierarchy. Most specific UIs interpret keyboard and mouse events and know when to switch the focus from one object to another. For example, in OSF/Motif, clicking on a window will switch the focus to that window from the previous focus window. Before the mouse is clicked, however, the focus exclusive of that window will not change. In other specific UIs which incorporate real-estate cursor behavior, merely moving the cursor over a window will transfer the focus to that window.</P>
<P>
By default, an application will come up with certain objects having the focus exclusive within their focus levels. This allows the user to immediately begin typing or operating on data.

Using Target</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="Input_15.htm_IX_Target">
 </A>
The specific UI handles most of the manipulation of the target hierarchy. Most specific UIs interpret keyboard and mouse events and know when to switch the target from one object to another. For example, in OSF/Motif, clicking on a window will switch the target to that window from the previous target window. Before the mouse is clicked, however, the target exclusive of that window will not change. In other specific UIs which incorporate real-estate cursor behavior, merely moving the cursor over a window will transfer the target to that window.</P>
<P>
By default, an application will come up with certain objects having the target exclusive within their target levels. This allows the user to immediately begin typing or operating on data. For an object to grab the default exclusive, it must first be targetable. A targetable object can be any child of a valid target node. Valid nodes for the target hierarchy are:</P>

Using Model</H3>
<P>
<A NAME="Input_16.htm_IX_Model">
 </A>
In some cases, you may need to send or receive information from some object other than the focus or target. The Model hierarchy is provided as an alternative. In most cases, the model provides a means of pointing to data selections other than that pointed to by the Target hierarchy. Only use it if the target hierarchy cannot serve your needs.</P>
<P>
The model of an application is used to identify objects that represent the actual data that can be selected by the user. Typically, these selections are either secondary selections or are not visible. The selections are frequently operated on with the use of menus, dialog boxes, or other UI gadgetry. Only one object at each model level may have the model &quot;exclusive,&quot; and for an object to &quot;have the Model&quot; of an application, that object must have a continuous path of model exclusives up to the application object.</P>
<P>
Only GenSystem, GenApplication, and the document control objects can be directly used in the Model hierarchy without any modifications. To use other objects in the Model hierarchy, you must first subclass those objects' classes and add an instance field and several message handlers pertaining to the Model hierarchy. Any object which is a valid target node can be subclassed in this manner.</P>
<P>
By default, an application will come up with certain objects having the model exclusive within their model levels. This allows the user to immediately begin operating on data. For an object to grab the default exclusive, it must first be modelable. Only objects which are modelable may have the model exclusive. A modelable object can be any child of a valid model node. Valid nodes for the Model hierarchy are the same as for the Target hierarchy. However, a document control object must also be set GDCA_MODELABLE to grab the model exclusive. Remember that just because an object is a valid node does not mean it can exhibit the behavior of the Model hierarchy; you must subclass most objects for this to occur.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Input_16.htm_IX_HINT_DEFAULT_MODEL">
 </A>
For objects within a model level, the model will be granted first to any object with <CODE>
HINT_DEFAULT_MODEL</CODE>
 in its instance data. If no object has this hint at a particular model level, then the model will be granted to the first modelable object at that level.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Input_16.htm_IX_MSG_META_SEND_CLASSED_EVENT:to model">

The easiest way to deliver a message to an object in the active Model hierarchy is to use <CODE>
MSG_META_SEND_CLASSED_EVENT</CODE>

To remove the model exclusive from an object without setting it to another object, use <CODE>
MSG_META_RELEASE_MODEL_EXCL</CODE>
. Note that these messages only modify the model exclusive of a single object. Therefore, they only affect the model pointer of the parent; further up the Model hierarchy there is no effect. Changing the model exclusive of an object will only change the direction of the model path if all ancestors of the new model exclusive are also model exclusives.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Input_16.htm_IX_MSG_META_GET_MODEL_EXCL">
 </A>
To check which model exclusive a composite points to, send it a <CODE>
MSG_META_GET_MODEL_EXCL</CODE>
. This message will return the optr of the model child. The returned object may not have the model properties, though, for the reasons above. Never send a message directly to the object returned by this method as it may have been changed in the meantime. Use <CODE>

Extending the Hierarchies</H3>

You may also extend or modify the hierarchies to add other objects that are not active nodes by default. If custom objects wish to use the hierarchies, you will need to add instance data and message handlers for their classes. The following steps must be taken to add a new node in a hierarchy:</P>
<OL>

Add a hierarchical instance field of type <CODE>

Add a handler for <CODE>

. This method alters the custom instance field for the grab and release messages for all hierarchies. You must call the superclass in your handler.</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
Add methods to handle the GAINED and LOST messages pertaining to the particular hierarchy you are extending. These methods should call <CODE>
FlowUpdateHierarchicalGrab()</CODE>
. You can also add behavior exhibited when the object gains or loses the exclusive. Depending on what you are subclassing, your default behavior may already take care of this. For instance subclasses of <CODE>
VisClass</CODE>
 automatically handle losing and gaining the target exclusive.</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
Add a method to handle the GET message for the particular hierarchy you are extending. This method returns the optr of the object set in the new instance field. The method should return <EM>
true</EM>
 to signal that it is capable of gaining the exclusive.</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
Add the capability to handle the <CODE>
MSG_META_SEND_CLASSED_EVENT </CODE>
with the <CODE>
TravelOption</CODE>
 of the particular hierarchy you are extending. The way you handle this message depends on the hierarchy affected, as discussed below.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
TO_FOCUS and TO_TARGET requests should only travel down hierarchies of the same name. If no further travel is possible, the method should pass the event on to the superclass for handling. TO_MODEL requests should only travel down the Model hierarchy if it exists and the next optr is non-null.</P>
