 The Clipboard

</H1>
<P>
<A NAME="index.htm_IX_Clipboard">
 </A>
For an application to survive in the GUI world today, it must support at least the ever-present &quot;Cut, Copy, and Paste&quot; functions to which users have grown so attached. GEOS makes this very simple through the Clipboard and Quick-Transfer mechanisms.</P>
<P>
All applications should support and use these mechanisms in order to maintain consistency throughout the system. In addition, these mechanisms provide certain functionality for data transfer that can be easily used.</P>
<P>
To understand this chapter fully, you should have a working knowledge of Virtual Memory management as well as some familiarity with the concepts of mouse input. However, the concepts of the Clipboard and quick-transfer mechanisms are simple and may be understood without having read those sections.

<H2 CLASS="sectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">The Clipboard</A>: 1 
Overview</H2>
<P>
The user understands two ways to cut and paste information: The first is to use the Edit menu and the <EM>
Cut</EM>
, <EM>
Copy</EM>
, and <EM>
Paste</EM>
 functions. The second is to use the mouse by selecting and dragging text, graphics, or objects with the quick-copy and quick-move functions. For a full description of how these two operations are accomplished, see the<EM>
 </EM>
user's guide provided in the Geoworks retail products.</P>
<P>
Both these functions use similar data structures; a single flag determines whether the operation is a quick-transfer or a normal Clipboard operation. However, the procedures and rules of usage have significant differences.</P>
<P>
You should be familiar with the features and uses of both the Clipboard and the quick-transfer mechanism. If you are, you can skip this section; however, if you are not familiar with the features and rules governing the Edit menu and the quick-transfer operations, you most likely will want to read this section.</P>

<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">The Clipboard</A>: 1.1 <A HREF="#Clipboard_1.htm">Overview</A>: 
Cut, Copy, and Paste</H3>
<P>
Even the simplest, text-using applications provide an Edit menu with the <EM>
Cut</EM>
, <EM>
Copy</EM>
, and <EM>
Paste</EM>
 options. 
<IMG SRC="Clipboard_2_editMenu.gif">

</P>
<P>
The Edit menu works with a hidden data area called the <EM>
Clipboard</EM>
. The Clipboard has no visual representation, and it can contain any format of data from text to graphics strings to custom formats defined by applications. The Clipboard's structure and implementation are completely invisible to the user beyond the functions <EM>
Cut</EM>
, <EM>
Copy</EM>
, and <EM>
Paste</EM>
.</P>
<P>
The most common use of the Edit menu is within a word processor or draw program. For example, when a user wants to place a graphic from GeoDraw into GeoWrite, or when he wants to rearrange text in his NotePad, he can use the cut, copy, and paste operations.</P>
<P>
When a user selects an item such as the word &quot;puddle,&quot; the <EM>
Cut</EM>
 option becomes enabled. This indicates that the user can remove the selection from the document and it will be placed on the Clipboard (anything already on the Clipboard will be replaced with the selection). When nothing is selected, the <EM>
Cut</EM>
 option is disabled.</P>
<P>
In order to enable the <EM>
Copy</EM>
 option, the user must select an item, just as with <EM>
Cut</EM>
. Copying, however, will not remove the selection from the document--it will simply create a copy of the selection and place it on the Clipboard, removing whatever had previously been on the Clipboard.</P>
<P>
Pasting is allowed only when something in a compatible data format is already sitting on the Clipboard. The <EM>
Paste</EM>
 operation copies what is on the Clipboard into a document at the current insertion point (in the case of text, this is where the cursor was last placed); if something is already selected, the selection will be replaced with the pasted material. If there is nothing on the Clipboard, then there is nothing to paste; therefore, the option is disabled.</P>
<HR>
<A NAME="Clipboard_3.htm"></A>


<H3 CLASS="subsectionTitle">
<A HREF="#index.htm">The Clipboard</A>: 1.2 <A HREF="#Clipboard_1.htm">Overview</A>: 
Quick-Transfer</H3>
<P>
The user can copy and move selected items without using the Edit menu; he simply drags the item using the quick-transfer button of his mouse, and the item will be either copied or moved.</P>
<P>
There are several rules which govern whether a move or copy is taking place. The user can override these rules with a certain set of keypresses to force either a copy or move. Copy is equivalent to using the <EM>
Copy</EM>
 and <EM>
Paste</EM>
 functions in succession, and move is equivalent to using the <EM>
Cut</EM>
 and <EM>
Paste</EM>
 functions in succession.</P>
<P>
The operation of a quick transfer (move or copy), however, depends on whether the transfer is across documents or internal to a single document. If the transfer is internal, it should become a move. If the transfer occurs across documents, it should become a copy. (Note that, for the purposes of quick-transfer, the term <EM>
document</EM>
 is used to refer to anything the user will conceptually view as a single data holder--for example, a GeoManager &quot;document&quot; consists of one disk.)</P>
<P>
Because not all documents will support a given transfer operation (for example, a text file editor can not receive a GeoDraw graphic), the user is provided with immediate feedback about the type and validity of the transfer.</P>
<P>
For example, if a GeoDraw ellipse was selected and a quick-transfer was begun, immediately the mouse pointer would show the transfer as a move operation. As the user moves the mouse outside the GeoDraw document and into another GeoDraw document, the cursor changes to indicate a copy operation. If the user then moves the mouse over a text-only document, a &quot;no operation,&quot; or &quot;invalid,&quot; cursor would be shown, indicating that the ellipse could not be received.</P>
<P>
Some applications may implement an additional feature that provides feedback to the user: modifying the source object as the type of transfer changes. For example, a drawing program may wish to alter the shape or color of an object while it is being quick-moved but leave it normal during a quick-copy or no-operation transfer.</P>

Transfer Data Structures</H2>
<P>
Both the Clipboard and quick-transfer mechanisms use similar structures to accomplish data transfer. These data structures are owned and managed by the GEOS User Interface; however, they are accessible to all geodes in the system through a number of routines and messages.

</P>
<P>
The Clipboard consists of a VM file known as the <EM>
Transfer VM File</EM>. The quick-transfer mechanism uses the same file for its data transfer. Typically, this is a file designated and managed by the User Interface.</P>
<P>
In addition, certain formats of data are supported automatically--GEOS text and graphics strings are special formats that are described below. Geodes can create their own specific formats; for example, GeoManager uses a special format for quick-transfer of files between disks and directories.</P>

The Transfer VM File is a normal VM file, managed by the UI. It contains several components, each of which is accessed through special routines that take care of nearly all the synchronization issues involved with the Clipboard and quick-transfer mechanisms. Because both the Clipboard and the quick-transfer mechanism use this file and its data structures, these structures are detailed here; the following section (<A HREF="#Clipboard_9.htm_50504"> Using The Clipboard</A>
) details how to use them for either the Clipboard or the quick-transfer mechanism.</P>
<P>
The Transfer VM File has one header block for the Clipboard transfer item and another for the quick-transfer transfer item. These headers have the same structure, and they contain all the information necessary to work with the file's contents.

Using The Clipboard</H2>
<PRE>ClipboardQueryItem(), ClipboardRegisterItem(), ClipboardDoneWithItem()</PRE>
<P>
To use the Clipboard, your application must have an Edit menu (or a GenEditControl object) and an object which can implement the Cut, Copy, and Paste operations. This object is often the application's Process object or some other coordinating object. This object must be able to do each of the things in the following list:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Register with the Clipboard<BR>
In a multitasking, multithreaded system, another application could change the Clipboard's contents. By registering with the Clipboard on application startup, the object will receive notification whenever the Clipboard's contents are changed (including when your application perpetrates the change). Registration is normally accomplished via the ClipboardAddToNotificationList() routine. The GCN notification list GCNSLT_TRANSFER_NOTIFICATION is used.Objects on this list can intercept <CODE>
MSG_META_CLIPBOARD_NOTIFY_NORMAL_TRANSFER_ITEM_CHANGED</CODE>
 and <CODE>
MSG_META_CLIPBOARD_NOTIFY_TRANSFER_ITEM_FREED</CODE>
.</LI>
<LI>
Maintain the Edit Menu<BR>
In order to provide the user with the <EM>
Cut</EM>
, <EM>
Copy</EM>
, and <EM>
Paste</EM>
 features, your application must have an Edit menu. Most programmers will simply include a GenEditControl object to create and maintain the Edit menu. Your clipboard-management object must update the triggers properly whenever the contents of the Clipboard are changed.</LI>
<LI>
Handle <CODE>
MSG_META_CLIPBOARD_COPY,</CODE>
 <CODE>
MSG_META_CLIPBOARD_CUT<BR>
</CODE>
When the user issues a Cut or Copy order, the object must put the proper data into the Clipboard Transfer VM File.</LI>
<LI>
Handle <CODE>
MSG_META_CLIPBOARD_PASTE<BR>
</CODE>
When the user issues a Paste order, the object must query the Clipboard to ensure a proper format is available and then copy the information from the Clipboard.</LI>
<LI>
Check out when shutting down<BR>
Each object that registers with the Clipboard must unregister when shutting down. Otherwise, the UI might try to send notification to a defunct object or process, resulting in unpredictable behavior.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Because the Clipboard is constantly in use by many different threads, you must always gain exclusive access to the transfer VM file when you want to use it. After you're done with the transfer file, you should relinquish exclusive access so other threads can continue to use it.</P>
<P>

The Edit menu is simply a normal menu with several standard triggers.

<P>
Some Edit menus may also contain other triggers such as &quot;Delete Event,&quot; or &quot;Remove Item.&quot; These triggers, however, are not standard and must be implemented exclusively by the application.</P>
<P>
Two main rules govern the maintenance of the Edit menu:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
The <EM>
Cut</EM>
 and <EM>
Copy</EM>
 triggers are enabled only when some data is selected that may be cut or copied from the document into the Clipboard.</LI>
<LI>
The <EM>
Paste</EM>
 trigger is enabled only when data in a pasteable format exists in the Clipboard's Transfer VM File.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
The first rule must be implemented entirely by the application; the Clipboard will not enable or disable the Copy or Cut triggers. The second rule, however, requires that the application be notified whenever the Clipboard's contents change--it is possible, for example, for the application to copy data to the Clipboard, enable its Paste trigger, and have another application then also copy some custom data to the Clipboard. In this case, the original application must disable its Paste trigger if it can not read the data.</P>
<P>
Whenever the Clipboard's contents change, the UI will send notification to all objects that have registered with it. The notification will be in the message <CODE>

 is a subclass of <CODE>
GenControlClass</CODE>
 (see <A HREF="../../SysObjects/Controllers/index.htm">the Controllers chapter</A> for usage of controllers in general).</P>
<P>
The GenEditControl object can provide triggers and/or tools for Undo, Cut, Copy, Paste, Select All, and Delete operations. These operations must all be handled by your application, of course, just as if you did not use a GenEditControl; using this controller, however, simplifies your UI programming and allows the Edit tools to be used by the GenToolControl.</P>

The features of the GenEditControl are listed below (they are flags of the <CODE>
GECFeatures</CODE>
 record type):</P>
<DL>
<DT>
GECF_UNDO</DT><DD>This feature adds an &quot;Undo&quot; trigger to the Edit menu. It sends <CODE>
MSG_META_UNDO</CODE>

The GenEditControl handles two different notification types: GWNT_SELECT_STATE_CHANGE, sent when the selection state changes, and GWNT_UNDO_STATE_CHANGE, sent when a state change in the Undo status occurs.

Cut and Copy are very similar in function; both put data onto the Clipboard. However, Cut causes the data to subsequently be deleted from the document, and Copy does not.</P>
<P>
When the user starts either of these operations, the object that handles them must go through a series of specific steps to load the data into the Clipboard's VM file. (For simplicity of example, this chapter will assume that the Process object will handle all Clipboard operations; this may not be the case in complex programs.)</P>
<P>
The steps are simple; each is enumerated below, and edited examples from the sample application ClipSamp are provided in <A HREF="#Clipboard_d.htm_78234"> MSG_META_CLIPBOARD_CUT</A>

Duplicate and attach the data<BR>
You must create a duplicate of whatever data is being loaded into the Clipboard. This step includes allocating new VM blocks in the Transfer VM File with <CODE>

MemAlloc()</CODE>

The text objects and the Ink object are the only exceptions to this; they provide their own Undo functions in response to <CODE>
MSG_META_UNDO</CODE>
. For more information on Undo and how it works in GEOS, see <A HREF="../../SysObjects/Meta/MetaClass_10.htm#36279">the MetaClass chapter</A>.</P><HR>

Using Quick-Transfer</H2>
<P>
<A NAME="Clipboard_13.htm_IX_Quick-transfer">
 </A>
An application must understand the Clipboard and its structure before being able to support the quick-transfer feature of the UI. However, because quick-transfer is such a convenient feature for users, every appropriate application should support it. To use the quick-transfer mechanism, you will probably want to understand how mouse input is handled.</P>
<P>
The quick-transfer mechanism makes extensive use of the Clipboard's data structures. However, this does not mean that when a quick-transfer is initiated, the Clipboard is altered. Instead, the Clipboard maintains a separate (but similar) data structure within the Transfer VM File.</P>
<P>
When a transfer is in progress, the distinction between a normal transfer and a quick transfer is made with the flag CIF_QUICK. When passed to the transfer mechanism's routines, this flag indicates that the quick-transfer item should be accessed and the Clipboard data should remain intact.</P>

Supporting Quick-Transfer</H3>
<P>
In order for an application to support the quick-transfer mechanism, it must be able to handle several situations. The list below enumerates all the tasks the application must be ready to perform:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Recognize initiation of a move/copy operation<BR>
When the user initiates a quick-transfer, the object under the mouse pointer will be notified the operation has begun.</LI>
<LI>
Provide feedback<BR>
Once a quick-transfer is initiated, every object on the screen becomes a potential destination for the transfer. When the mouse pointer moves over an object, that object must indicate what type of operation can be supported, if any.</LI>
<LI>
Receive the transfer item<BR>
If the move/copy operation is completed by the user when the mouse pointer is over an object, that object must be able to receive the item and provide feedback to the UI about the status of the quick-transfer.</LI>
<LI>
Recognize completion of the operation<BR>
When a quick-transfer is completed, the source object is notified and informed what type of operation took place.</LI>
<LI>
Shut off quick-transfer feedback on shutdown<BR>
When an object that can handle quick-transfers is shut down or destroyed, it must remove itself from the quick-transfer notification list. This takes care of any potential synchronization problems between object shutdown and the quick-transfer mechanism.</LI>
</UL>
<P>
Applications should also understand the three rules that govern the behavior of a quick-transfer:</P>
<UL>
<LI>
Transfers within a single document default to move operations.</LI>
<LI>
Transfers across documents default to copy operations.</LI>
<LI>
Transfers in a format not supported by the destination are &quot;no operation&quot; transfers.</LI>

<A HREF="#index.htm">The Clipboard</A>: 4.2 <A HREF="#Clipboard_13.htm">Using Quick-Transfer</A>: 
Quick-Transfer Procedure</H3>
<P>
Although applications must handle several situations to support the quick-transfer mechanism, the procedure involved in a quick-transfer is quite simple. The steps of how a quick-transfer operation is performed are outlined below:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
The user initiates a quick-transfer<BR>
By pressing the right mouse button (in OSF/Motif), the user initiates a quick-transfer. The UI recognizes the mouse press and sends <CODE>
MSG_META_START_MOVE_COPY</CODE>
 to the object under the pointer image.</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
The source object builds the transfer item<BR>
The object under the pointer image then becomes the &quot;source&quot; of the quick-transfer. It first calls <CODE>
ClipboardStartQuickTransfer()</CODE>
 to initiate the quick-transfer mechanism. It then builds the transfer item just as it would if the user had clicked on the Copy trigger in the Edit menu. It then logs the transfer item with the quick-transfer mechanism.</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
The source becomes a potential destination<BR>
Immediately after logging the transfer item, the source object becomes a potential destination of the quick-transfer. It must immediately provide feedback to the UI indicating whether it can accept the transfer item and whether the operation would be a move or a copy. The feedback is provided by calling <CODE>
ClipboardSetQuickTransferFeedback()</CODE>
. If the source object is a visible object in a GenView, it must also send the message <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_ALLOW_GLOBAL_TRANSFER</CODE>
 to itself to allow the pointer events to be sent to other objects in other windows (because the GenView grabs the mouse on the press).</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
The user moves the mouse<BR>
When the user moves the mouse (continuing to hold down the move/copy button), the pointer image may cross over several objects. Each of these is a potential destination and as such must provide feedback similar to that described in (3) above until the pointer moves outside of its bounds. Each object that receives a <CODE>
MSG_META_PTR</CODE>
 should check if a quick transfer is in progress by either checking the passed event flags or by calling <CODE>
ClipboardGetQuickTransferStatus()</CODE>
. The object should, in response, provide feedback as to whether it can accept the transfer item or not. It calls <CODE>
ClipboardSetQuickTransferFeedback()</CODE>
 with the proper feedback signal.</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
The user finishes the transfer<BR>
When the user lets up the move/copy button, the object under the pointer image (if any) becomes the destination object (it will receive a <CODE>
MSG_META_END_MOVE_COPY</CODE>
 from the UI).</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
The destination receives the transfer item<BR>
If the transfer item is in a receivable format, the destination will retrieve the item from the Transfer VM File just as if the user had selected the Paste trigger from the Edit menu (except the quick-transfer transfer item is received, not the Clipboard transfer item). The object first checks if it can take the item by calling <CODE>
ClipboardGetQuickItemInfo()</CODE>
 on the transfer item. If it can handle the item, it calls <CODE>
ClipboardQueryItem()</CODE>
, grabs the transfer item, and finally calls <CODE>
ClipboardEndQuickTransfer()</CODE>
.</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
The UI informs the source of the outcome<BR>
After the transfer has been completed by the destination, the UI will send a <CODE>
MSG_META_CLIPBOARD_NOTIFY_QUICK_TRANSFER_CONCLUDED</CODE>
 to the source object, informing it about the final outcome of the operation. Some source objects will change shape, shading, or color during a quick-transfer and must know when the transfer is concluded. If the operation is a quick-move, the source must delete the information or object that was moved.</LI>

Quick-Transfer Data Structures</H3>

The quick-transfer mechanism uses the same structures as the Clipboard. However, there are special data structures that are used exclusively by the quick-transfer mechanism. These data structures are used by individual UI routines and are documented with those routines.</P>

</PRE>
<P>
<A NAME="Clipboard_17.htm_IX_MSG_META_START_MOVE_COPY:signalling quick-transfer">
 </A>
When the user presses the move/copy button, the UI sends a <CODE>
MSG_META_START_MOVE_COPY</CODE>
 to the object under the mouse pointer. The selected object can be either a gadget run in the UI thread (such as a GenText object) or a process-run visible object within a view.</P>
<P>
If the object is a process-run visible object in a view, both the application object and the object under the mouse pointer will receive the notification message. If the object is UI-run, only it will receive the message.</P>
<P>
Receipt of this message tells an object to begin a quick-transfer operation. This operation consists of several steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
Grab the mouse to track it so you can find out when it leaves your object's bounds. (When it leaves, your object is no longer the destination.) Note that only objects need to grab the mouse; if a process is the content of the view, it does not have to.</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
Provide feedback to the quick-transfer mechanism immediately.</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
Build and register the transfer item.</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
Continue providing feedback as long as the mouse is in your bounds.</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
If desired, provide visual feedback to the user as the type of operation changes when the user moves the mouse pointer.</LI>
</OL>
<P>
The reason for providing feedback to the quick-transfer mechanism is simple: to indicate to the user what is going on. By giving information to the quick-transfer mechanism, objects allow the user to be informed immediately what type of operation is in progress--a move, a copy, or nothing at all.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Clipboard_17.htm_IX_ClipboardStartQuickTransfer()">
 </A>
Immediately after your object has grabbed the mouse, it should call the routine <CODE>
ClipboardStartQuickTransfer()</CODE>
. This routine allows the object not only to indicate which type of operation is in progress but also to attach a special graphical region to the cursor (though not required). This allows the application to provide additional information to the user as to what is going on (e.g. GeoManager attaches an image when a file transfer is initiated).</P>
<P>
You must also indicate to <CODE>
ClipboardStartQuickTransfer()</CODE>
 the object that will receive notification when the transfer has concluded. This is important because when a quick-move has been completed, the source object must ensure that the original copy of the item (usually the source object itself) is deleted.</P>
<P>
After calling <CODE>
ClipboardStartQuickTransfer()</CODE>
, the source object should duplicate and register the transfer item with the Transfer VM File. To do this, register the item as you normally would for a cut or copy operation (see <A HREF="#Clipboard_a.htm_46425"> Registering with the Clipboard</A>
); however, be sure to use the flag CIF_QUICK to ensure that the normal Clipboard data remains unaffected.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Clipboard_17.htm_IX_MSG_META_CLIPBOARD_NOTIFY_QUICK_TRANSFER_FEEDBACK">
 </A>
Once the transfer item has been registered, the source object becomes a potential destination and should act as such. However, you may wish to continue to provide source-related visual feedback to the user as long as the quick-transfer is going on: During a quick-transfer, the source will receive <CODE>
MSG_META_CLIPBOARD_NOTIFY_QUICK_TRANSFER_FEEDBACK</CODE>

 
each time the mode of the quick-transfer changes. This message will tell the source object what the current mode of transfer is in order for the source to give extra visual feedback to the user. This behavior is not required of the source object but can be beneficial to your application. It is also supplemental to the destination-related feedback that must be provided.</P>

<H4 CLASS="HeadingC">
Responsibilities of a Potential Destination</H4>
<PRE>ClipboardGetQuickTransferStatus(), ClipboardSetQuickTransferFeedback(), MSG_VIS_VUP_ALLOW_GLOBAL_TRANSFER, MSG_GEN_VIEW_ALLOW_GLOBAL_TRANSFER</PRE>
<P>
All objects that can potentially receive a transfer item are considered potential destinations during a quick-transfer operation. During the operation, the user will likely move the mouse pointer across the screen, entering and leaving several different potential destinations.</P>
<P>
When the mouse first moves over the object, the object will receive a <CODE>
MSG_META_PTR</CODE>
. When your object receives this message, it must provide immediate feedback to the transfer mechanism to indicate whether a move, a copy, or no operation is to be performed (the object should provide this feedback with the understanding that the operation type is what would happen if the transfer were to conclude at that moment).</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Clipboard_17.htm_IX_ClipboardGetQuickTransferStatus()">
 </A>
When the first <CODE>
MSG_META_PTR</CODE>
 is received, the object should call the routine <CODE>
ClipboardGetQuickTransferStatus()</CODE>
. This routine returns whether a quick-transfer is in progress; if so, the object should acquire a mouse grab in order to provide feedback until the mouse pointer leaves its bounds.</P>
<P>
The object should then check the quick-transfer Clipboard for supported formats. This is done just as with the Clipboard--with the routine <CODE>
ClipboardQueryItem()</CODE>
. If no supported formats are available, the object should provide the &quot;no operation&quot; feedback. However, if one or more is available, the object should determine whether the operation is a move or copy (call <CODE>
ClipboardGetItemInfo()</CODE>
) and act accordingly.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Clipboard_17.htm_IX_ClipboardSetQuickTransferFeedback()">
 </A>
To provide feedback, the object must call <CODE>
ClipboardSetQuickTransferFeedback()</CODE>
 in its method for <CODE>
MSG_META_PTR</CODE>
.<A NAME="Clipboard_17.htm_IX_ClipboardQuickTransferFeedback">
 </A>
 This routine sets the mode of the transfer to one of the enumerated type <CODE>
ClipboardQuickTransferFeedback</CODE>
. If the format is not supported, <CODE>
ClipboardSetQuickTransferFeedback()</CODE>
 is passed CQTF_CLEAR.</P>
<P>
When the mouse has left an object's bounds, the object must relinquish its mouse grab. Either a <CODE>
MSG_META_CONTENT_LOST_GADGET_EXCLUSIVE</CODE>
 or a <CODE>
MSG_META_PTR</CODE>
 with the UIFA_IN flag cleared will indicate this situation to the object. The former occurs when the mouse has moved onto a window or other object that is obscuring your object, and the latter is a result of the mouse moving outside of your bounds altogether.</P>
<P>
At this point, the object must do two things: Reset the mouse cursor and re-transmit the last mouse pointer event.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Clipboard_17.htm_IX_CQTF_CLEAR">
 </A>
To reset the mouse pointer, call <CODE>
ClipboardSetQuickTransferFeedback()</CODE>
 and pass it CQTF_CLEAR. This will set the default cursor. To re-send the last pointer event received (you must do this because the last one occurred outside your object's bounds and might have been within another object's bounds), you simply have to return the flag MRF_REPLAY when releasing the mouse grab.</P>
<P>
If the source object wishes a quick transfer to be able to be carried outside its view, it must send <CODE>
MSG_VIS_VUP_ALLOW_GLOBAL_TRANSFER</CODE>
 to itself. Process objects acting as a content must send <CODE>
MSG_GEN_VIEW_ALLOW_GLOBAL_TRANSFER</CODE>
 to the GenView.</P>
<P>
The object then becomes oblivious to future quick-transfer events until the pointer returns to its window (or unless it was registered for notification of quick-transfer conclusion).</P>

<P>
Upon receipt of this message, the object should first determine the move/copy/no-operation behavior as above, with one exception: If either of the flags CQNF_MOVE or CQNF_COPY is set for the transfer item, then the user has overridden the normal behavior and the destination object should respond with the appropriate operation.</P>
<P>
After determining the proper action, the object should retrieve the transfer item (as it would from the Clipboard), passing one of CQNF_MOVE, CQNF_COPY, or CQNF_NO_OPERATION. This flag will cause the proper notification to be sent to the transfer's source and allow it to complete its actions properly. <A NAME="Clipboard_17.htm_IX_ClipboardEndQuickTransfer()">
