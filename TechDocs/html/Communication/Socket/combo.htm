This chapter describes interactions with the Socket library, used for managing communications between threads -- threads on different machines or two GEOS threads on the same machine (via the &quot;loopback&quot; communication domain). It provides an API which is mostly independent of the medium used for inter-machine communication.</P>
<P>
It is common to spawn a separate thread to poll a socket for incoming data; See <A HREF="../../Kernel/MultiThread/index.htm">the Multithreading chapter</A> to learn about managing threads. Sample applications are located in APPL\SDK_C\MultThrd. Some socket operations require knowledge of the communications network used.

Introduction</H2>
<P>
<A NAME="Socket_1.htm_IX_Socket library">
 </A>
The Socket library manages communications both between machines and between threads on the same machine. It provides a level of abstraction above individual communication protocols (<EM>
e.g.</EM>
, IrLMP, TCP/IP). Programs using the Socket library can send and receive information packets without knowing much about the communications protocol by which those packets are being transmitted. Also, programs using the Socket library need not know about the hardware communication ports used -- whether communication is being carried out over an IR serial port, a modem, or a network connection -- the API is the same. </P>
<P>
<A NAME="Socket_1.htm_IX_SDT_&ldots;">
 </A>
<A NAME="Socket_1.htm_IX_SocketDeliveryType">
 </A>
The Socket library supports different &quot;delivery types&quot;-- different levels of reliability in transmitting data. There is a trade-off: the more reliable delivery types require more set-up work by the programs using them. The following delivery types are available:</P>
<DL>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Datagram</STRONG>
</DT><DD>Unreliable transmission of discrete packets. Packets may arrive out of order or not at all. It is up to the data sender to determine if re-transmission is necessary. This is the least demanding delivery type to set up, because it doesn't require any two-way connection.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Sequenced Packet</DT><DD>
</STRONG>
Sequenced Packet delivery means reliable transmission of discrete packets. The packets arrive in the order sent. The Socket library manages error checking and re-transmissions, as necessary. The program using a sequenced packet socket is responsible for establishing a two-way communications connection.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Stream</STRONG>
</DT><DD>Stream delivery means the reliable transmission of a stream of bytes, as opposed to other delivery types which require that data be broken up into packets. The Socket library manages a stream of bytes, breaking it up into packets, transmitting the packets, and reconstructing the byte stream from packets on the other side. The Socket library also manages error-checking and re-transmission, as necessary. The program using a stream socket is responsible for establishing a two-way communications connection.</DD>

</DL>
<H5 CLASS="HeadingD">
Addresses</H5>
<P>
Each side of the connection is represented by an address. An address is made up of several parts:</P>
<DL>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Domain</STRONG>
</DT><DD>The network over which the connection is being made. Domains include TCP/IP, IRLAP, and &quot;loopback&quot; (used for connections between two threads on the same machine).</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Address Data</DT><DD>
</STRONG>
This data identifies a machine on a network domain. The format of the address depends on the domain. In the case of TCP/IP, a sample address might be the string &quot;geoworks.com&quot;. IrLAP addresses are 32-bit numbers. If the domain is &quot;loopback&quot;, then no address information is necessary -- the sending and receiving machines are one and the same.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
Port</STRONG>
</DT><DD>This token identifies one side of a connection within one machine. Ports allow multiple data sockets to operate over one connection. Thus, connecting to &quot;geoworks.com&quot;, one might send mail messages using port 25 and file-transfer commands via port 21. Port numbers are either 16-bit or 32-bit, depending on the domain.</DD>
</DL>
<P>
The amount of overhead associated with sending and receiving data depends upon the devices involved, the domain, and the delivery type. When testing, experiment with different domains (if available), delivery types, and packet sizes to find a good balance of reliability and rapidity.</P>
<P>
For any domain, there may be more than one address format. For instance, the TCP/IP address &quot;geoworks.com&quot; is conveniently human-readable, but cannot be used at the socket level to actually make a connection. Instead, you must resolve &quot;geoworks.com&quot; to a 32-bit address number. All socket operations require &quot;primitive&quot; addresses -- addresses resolved to their simplest form. To resolve an address, call <CODE>
SocketResolve()</CODE>
. We will discuss the details of working with addresses in more detail below.</P>


<H5 CLASS="HeadingD">
Errors</H5>
<P>
Many of the Socket library routines return error values. Sometimes these error values are return values of routines; if you call a routine that can return an error value, be sure to check the return value and react appropriately to errors. Some routines don't return an error value directly, instead returning a flag to indicate that something has gone wrong. To find out exactly what went wrong, call <CODE>
ThreadGetError()</CODE>
. </P>
<P>
Those Socket library routines that return error values do not set the thread error value. Calling <CODE>
ThreadGetError()</CODE>
 after calling such a routine would not detect any error encountered by that routine.</P>
<P>
<CODE>
ThreadGetError()</CODE>
 returns a word-sized value. The low byte of this word is a <CODE>
SocketError</CODE>
 value; the high byte is a <CODE>
SpecSocketDrError</CODE>
 value. If the returned word is zero, that means that there was no error. </P>
<P>
<A NAME="Socket_1.htm_IX_SSDE_&ldots;">
 </A>
<A NAME="Socket_1.htm_IX_SpecSocketDrError values">
 </A>
In general, a <CODE>
SpecSocketDrError</CODE>
 value indicates a low-level error, and a <CODE>
SocketError</CODE>
 value indicates a high-level error. In many cases, there will be a <CODE>
SocketError</CODE>
 in the low byte, but the high byte will be clear -- there was no problem with the low-level communication medium, but a protocol exception may have occurred.</P>
<P>
In general, only the low byte (the <CODE>
SocketError</CODE>
 value) is useful in determining how to handle the exception. The high byte might affect what error message is displayed to the user. For example, it probably doesn't matter to your program whether the high byte was SSDE_LINE_BUSY or SSDE_NO_DIALTONE. In either case, it just means that communication could not be established. However, users might want to know the nature of the problem so that they can figure out how fix it.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Socket_1.htm_IX_SocketError">
 </A>
<A NAME="Socket_1.htm_IX_SE_&ldots;">
 </A>
Some of the more common <CODE>
SocketError</CODE>
 values are listed below. In addition, certain routines may make use of other <CODE>
SocketError</CODE>
 values, which will be discussed with those routines.</P>
<DL>
<DT>
SE_NORMAL</DT><DD>
There is no error. SE_NORMAL is guaranteed to equal zero.</DD>
<DT>
SE_OUT_OF_MEMORY</DT><DD>
The Socket library ran out of memory. Perhaps it was trying to receive or send a data packet that was too large.</DD>
<DT>
SE_SOCKET_IN_USE</DT><DD>
The socket was busy doing something else. Perhaps you tried to connect it, but it was already connected.</DD>
<DT>
SE_SOCKET_BUSY</DT><DD>
The socket was temporarily busy doing something else. Perhaps you should try again a few times.</DD>
<DT>
SE_MEDIUM_BUSY</DT><DD>
The hardware port which would be used to carry out the requested operation was busy. You might wait for the hardware port to become free; you could call <CODE>
SocketCheckMediumConnection()</CODE>
 to see if the port is being used for a socket connection.</DD>
<DT>
SE_ALL_PORTS_BUSY</DT><DD>
To carry out the requested operation, the Socket library tried to use a port number; however all port numbers were already busy. </DD>
<DT>
SE_SOCKET_NOT_BOUND</DT><DD>
The socket was not bound (<EM>
i.e.</EM>
, associated with a port number), but needed to be bound to carry out the requested operation. To bind a socket, call <CODE>
SocketBind()</CODE>
.</DD>
<DT>
SE_SOCKET_NOT_LISTENING</DT><DD>
The socket wasn't listening for incoming connections, and needed to be in this state to carry out the requested operation. To make a socket listen, call <CODE>
SocketListen()</CODE>
.</DD>
<DT>
SE_SOCKET_LISTENING</DT><DD>
The socket was busy listening for incoming connections when you asked it to carry out another operation. Remember that you often want separate sockets to handle listening and data transfer.</DD>
<DT>
SE_SOCKET_NOT_CONNECTED</DT><DD>
The socket was not connected, but a connection is required for the operation you requested. To connect the socket, call <CODE>
SocketConnect()</CODE>
.</DD>
<DT>
SE_SOCKET_CLOSED</DT><DD>
The socket was closed, making the requested operation impossible.</DD>
<DT>
SE_CONNECTION_CLOSED</DT><DD>
The other side of your socket's connection has closed that connection; to close up your side of the connection, call <CODE>
SocketClose()</CODE>
. </DD>
<DT>
SE_CONNECTION_FAILED</DT><DD>
The connection was lost, probably due to some low-level link failure. There may have been a problem with the physical connection or with the domain-specific software.</DD>
<DT>
SE_CONNECTION_RESET</DT><DD>
The connection was lost, probably due to this side of the connection intentially making a low-level disconnection; <EM>
e.g.</EM>
, the sort of disconnection that results from <CODE>
SocketCloseDomainMedium()</CODE>
 or the Socket's owning thread exiting.</DD>
<DT>
SE_TIMED_OUT</DT><DD>
The Socket library was unable to carry out the requested operation before the time-out time was reached. Beware: Depending on the domain, for certain phases of certain operations, there may be low-level time-outs which can occur even if you have specified a longer or an infinite time-out. </DD>
<DT>
SE_CANT_LOAD_DRIVER</DT><DD>
The Socket library was unable to load a driver necessary to carry out the requested operation.</DD>
<DT>
SE_UNKNOWN_DOMAIN</DT><DD>
The Socket library didn't recognize the domain name.</DD>
<DT>
SE_DESTINATION_UNREACHABLE</DT><DD>
The requested destination address was unreachable over the network.</DD>
<DT>
SE_LINK_FAILED</DT><DD>
The low-level link used for this connection failed or could not be established. There may have been a problem with the physical connection or with the domain-specific software.</DD>
<DT>
SE_SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN</DT><DD>
This error signals that GEOS is shutting down. Your program should probably either end its connections gracefully or attempt to delay the shutdown. Note that it is possible for a shutdown to occur without generating this signal.</DD>
<DT>
SE_INFO_NOT_AVAILABLE</DT><DD>
The requested information was not available. </DD>
<DT>
SE_DOMAIN_REQUIRES_16BIT_PORTS</DT><DD>
You tried to use a 32-bit port number in a domain that does not support them. Use MANUFACTURER_ID_SOCKET_16BIT_PORT as the <CODE>
ManufacturerID</CODE>
 of your port number.</DD>
<DT>
SE_INTERRUPT</DT><DD>
The operation was stymied by <CODE>
SocketInterrupt()</CODE>
.</DD>
<DT>
SE_INTERNAL_ERROR</DT><DD>
The Socket library did something wrong. You should take advantage of whatever developer support to which you have access. They will want a back-trace and other information necessary to duplicate the error.</DD>

Simple Example</H2>
<P>
The sample application Appl/SDK_C/Talk provides an example of a simple application using the Socket library.</P>
<P>
To understand how the program works, you should, of course, look at its source code. The following is a high-level overview of what the Talk example illustrates: a simple client-server connection in which the server awaits connections, the client connects, and then the two exchange data. Note: this application assumes that the host device (the client) has already connected to the server. Remote connections are usually made through PPP or Point-to-Point Protocol. See <CODE>
SocketOpenDomainMedium()</CODE>
 discussed in <A HREF="#Socket_6.htm_79399"> Hardware Ports</A>
.</P>
<P>
The example performs the following steps:</P>
<OL>
<LI>
<STRONG>
Allocate memory in which to store data.<BR>
</STRONG>
When sending or receiving data, you need to provide a pointer to a buffer containing the data to be sent or received. Thus, the buffer should be in a block which can either be locked down as needed or is in fixed memory. Programs often spawn a separate thread to receive data from the socket; if this thread needs to lock down a memory block in which to store the data, then make sure that the thread can lock down the memory block. See <A HREF="../../Kernel/MultiThread/index.htm">the Multithreading chapter</A> to learn about managing threads.<BR>
(If you follow the multi-threaded approach, be aware that when the Socket's owning thread exits, it frees the Socket. To allow a Socket to survive the exit of its thread, use <CODE>
SocketSetIntSocketOption()</CODE>
 to change its owning thread.)<BR>
For this simple example, we're using a small buffer to handle the receipt of data, so we declare it as a global variable so it resides in the application's fixed memory:</LI>

<UL>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
<STRONG>
Client Side: Make Sure Connected to Domain<BR>
</STRONG>
Depending on the nature of the device and application, you may need to make sure that the device is connected to the communication domain. In the Talk sample application, we make sure that the device is dialed in to an ISP: an <CODE>
AccessPointControl</CODE>
 object prompts the user to choose an ISP, and a call to <CODE>
SocketOpenDomainMedium()</CODE>
 opens a PPP connection to that ISP.</LI>
<LI FIXME_NumListOther>
<STRONG>
Client Side: Get Address For Other Side of Connection.<BR>
</STRONG>
The Talk application allows the user to connect with another machine by specifying that machine's address. The Talk application creates a controller gadget by which the user can specify an address. <CODE>
SocketGetAddressController()</CODE>
 returns the controller class' pointer; <CODE>
ObjInstantiate()</CODE>
 creates an object of the class.<BR>
The following code is called when the application opens. It creates the controller gadget, initializes its data, and places it in a dialog box.</LI>

<P FIXME_BulListNoBul>
	<CODE>
MSG_SOCKET_ADDRESS_CONTROL_GET_ADDRESSES</CODE>
 returns a chunk with raw address data based on the address entered by the user. <CODE>

	There are two &quot;sockets&quot; created on this, the server side of the connection. The first socket is bound to a particular port, and &quot;listens&quot; for incoming connections.

Either Side: Close Connection<BR>
</STRONG>
The application has a Close button. When the user presses this button, the application shuts down its side of the connection. The <CODE>

In the example above, the application queried the user for a connection address. This is a fairly common case. However, some programs need to use hard-wired addresses. Perhaps you want to allow connections over all available domains. Thus, a few words about addresses may be in order.</P>
<P>
Addresses are usually represented via the <CODE>
SocketAddress</CODE>
 structure:</P>
<PRE>typedef struct {
	SocketPort 		SA_port;
	word 		SA_domainSize;
	char *		SA_domain;

<DT>
<STRONG>
SA_port</STRONG>
</DT><DD><A NAME="Socket_3.htm_SocketPort structure">
 </A>
Port numbers identify a particular line of communication within a machine. Port numbers may be 32-bit or 16-bit, depending on the domain. They are specified via the <CODE>
SocketPort</CODE>
 structure, made up of a 16-bit <CODE>
ManufacturerID</CODE>
 and 16-bit arbitrarily-chosen token number. If the domain uses 16-bit socket numbers, then use MANUFACTURER_ID_SOCKET_16BIT_PORT<A NAME="Socket_3.htm_MANUFACTURER_ID_SOCKET_16BIT_PORT">
 </A>
 as the <CODE>
ManufacturerID</CODE>
. If the domain allows 32-bit socket numbers, then you may use MANUFACTURER_ID_SOCKET_16BIT_PORT or some other <CODE>
ManufacturerID</CODE>
, probably your own ID or that of some standard service provider. This numbering scheme helps to avoid overlapping port numbers.</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
SA_domain</STRONG>
, <STRONG>
SA_domainSize</DT><DD>
</STRONG>
The domain identifies the protocol of the network by which the addressed machine may be reached. The domain is specified by a string. In a <CODE>
SocketAddress</CODE>
 structure, <CODE>
SA_domain</CODE>
 is a pointer to the null-terminated domain name string and <CODE>
SA_domainSize</CODE>
 is the size of the buffer containing the domain name string.</DD>
<DT>
</DT><DD>Many communications protocols are hard-wired to work with a particular domain. To find out all domains available to the user's device, call <CODE>
SocketGetDomain().</CODE>
 (See <A HREF="#Socket_4.htm_41559"> Letting the User Choose an Address</A>
.)</DD>
<DT>
<STRONG>
SA_addressSize</STRONG>
, <STRONG>
Address Data</DT><DD>
</STRONG>
The format of the address data used to identify a machine within a domain depends on that domain. The <CODE>
SA_addressSize</CODE>
 field of the <CODE>
SocketAddress</CODE>
 structure contains the size of the address data. The buffer containing the address data should fall immediately after the <CODE>
SocketAddress</CODE>
 structure. Read the documentation for a given domain to find out the format for its addresses.<BR>
You'll want to make sure that space for this data is, in fact, allocated at the end of the structure. If you declare a socket address, you will define a struct, probably based on <CODE>
SocketAddress</CODE>
, that has the fields of <CODE>
SocketAddress</CODE>
, but also has a buffer to hold the resolved address data. More likely than not, you won't need to declare or define such a structure -- you're more likely to use <CODE>
SocketCreateResolvedAddress()</CODE>
 or bypass the creation of this structure altogether.</DD>
</DL>
<P>
Before using an address, make sure that it is in its primitive form. For instance, an IP address like &quot;geoworks.com&quot; is not in its primitive form -- the IP address must be translated into a four-byte number before it can be used. Use <CODE>
SocketResolve()</CODE>
 (described below) to transform an address into its primitive form. Note that the address passed to <CODE>
SocketResolve()</CODE>
 is not in a <CODE>

You cannot use an address with Socket library routines unless that address is in its primitive form. This primitive form is created by taking a higher-level form of the address and passing it to the <CODE>
SocketCreateResolvedAddress()</CODE>
 routine or the <CODE>
SocketResolve()</CODE>
 routine. Exactly how the Socket library resolves the address depends upon the domain.</P>
<P>
Recall that addresses returned by the address controller are not in their primitive form. The primitive form of an address can be volatile: feel free to re-use them if making several connections over a short period of time, but re-resolve the address if it's been a long time since it was last resolved. Note that there can be a large overhead when it comes to resolving addresses. Also note that IRLAP numeric addresses are especially volatile, changing every time the protocol connection starts, <EM>
i.e.,</EM>
 every time the IRLAP driver is loaded, either for the first time or after more than a minute of inactivity.</P>
<P>
<A NAME="Socket_4.htm_IX_SocketCreateResolvedAddress()">

The <CODE>
SocketCreateResolvedAddress()</CODE>

<P>
The resolution process may or may not require network access, depending on the domain and the input format. Depending on the domain, the addressing system may be volatile. Under these conditions, put off resolving the address as long as possible, until just before using the address; there will be less time for the address to go bad.

If there are only non-datagram-based sockets bound to a port, you may bind a datagram-based socket to that port without setting SBF_REUSE_PORT. The reverse is also true.

<P>
In some domains, only one byte of data in a packet can be marked urgent. In such a domain, passing SSF_URGENT with a 32-byte packet to <CODE>

<P>
Note that in some domains, the driver may delay before sending small packets of data because it is waiting for more packets to combine into one large packet. In many cases, this leads to more efficient communication. You may turn off this behavior by setting the &quot;no delay&quot; option. See <A HREF="#Socket_d.htm_20519"> SO_NODELAY: No Delay for small packets To force a driver to send small packets without waiting for other packets to bundle together.

The <CODE>
SocketRecv()</CODE>
 routine receives data from the socket. After filling the passed buffer with data, the socket discards its copy of the received data to make room for the next piece of incoming data.</P>
<P>
Sequenced packet or datagram delivery sockets can only receive whole packets. If you grab data from the socket but don't grab all the data in the packet, the remaining data is lost. Thus, it's a good idea to establish a maximum packet size for sockets using these delivery types. If you're not sure how much room you'll need to receive a packet, call <CODE>
SocketRecv()</CODE>
 with the SRF_PEEK flag. This allows you to &quot;peek&quot; at the incoming data without causing the socket to discard its copy.</P>

The number of 1/60 second ticks to wait for incoming data. Pass SOCKET_NO_TIMEOUT to wait forever.</DD>

The address data information with a <CODE>
SocketAddress</CODE>
 structure takes the following form for the TCP domain:</LI>
<PRE>typedef struct {
	word    <A NAME="Socket_11.htm_IX_TOEA_&ldots;"> </A>TOEA_linkSize; 				/* 0 */
	byte    TOEA_ipAddr[4]; /* IP address */
} <A NAME="Socket_11.htm_IX_TcpOnlyResolvedAddress"> </A>TcpOnlyResolvedAddress;</PRE>
<P>
	A variation on this structure is used for storing the address information for a TCP access point address. Along with the address information, there are three bytes of information about the nature of the link: the first of these bytes should have value LT_ID, so that the driver will know that the next two bytes represent a link ID; the other two bytes should be the access point's ID.</P>
<PRE>typedef struct {
	word	TAPRA_linkSize; /* 3 */
	byte	TAPRA_linkType; /* LinkType (LT_ID) */
	word	TAPRA_accPntID;
	byte	 <A NAME="Socket_11.htm_IX_TAPRA_&ldots;"> </A>TAPRA_ipAddr[4]; /* IP address */
