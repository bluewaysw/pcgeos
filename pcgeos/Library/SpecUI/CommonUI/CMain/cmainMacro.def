COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		SetZFlag
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Ensure the ZFlag is set

PASS:		nothing

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
		Compare ax to itself.  This is nondestructive, and
	we know it will always be equal, or 'zero' difference

KNOWN BUGS/SIDE EFFECTS/IDEAS:
	clears the carry as well

COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		ClearZFlag
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Ensure the ZFlag is clear

PASS:		nothing

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
	sp won't ever be zero, so or'ing with zero will result in a non-
	zero quantity.  Or'ing with zero is non-destructive.

KNOWN BUGS/SIDE EFFECTS/IDEAS:
	clears the carry
