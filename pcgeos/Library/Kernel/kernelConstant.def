;	BULLET
;	REDWOOD
;	NIKE_XIP

ifndef HARDWARE_TYPE
HARDWARE_TYPE			equ	<PC>
endif

;
;  The HARDWARE_TYPE is used through-out the kernel to conditionally
; compile code that depends upon hardware support.  For each of the
; different HARDWARE_TYPEs, there are different hardware support
; levels.  These hardware support levels are listed below:
;
;  KERNEL_EXECUTE_IN_PLACE : Defines whether or not the kernel is
;	executing in place from ROM.  This meains all non-writable
;	blocks (including the core block) are read only.  This allows
;	XIP machines to have much larger heaps (as most of the
;	to code doesn't need to loaded in RAM) and hence execute
;	faster.
;
;  FULL_EXECUTE_IN_PLACE : Indicates that a kernel which is going to
;	be used in a system where all geodes (or most, at any rate)
;	are to be executed out of ROM.  It should not be used with
;	KERNEL_EXECUTE_IN_PLACE, as FULL XIP entails a different
;	scheme (The kernel executes out of banks, as opposed to
;	occupying the lower part of conventional memory...) that
;	affects the entire system, not just the kernel.
;
;  POQET_SUPPORT : Defines whether or not the kernel should include
;	code to support Poqet and PoqetPad.
;
;  SMALL_SCREEN_SYS_NOTIFY : Indicates whether or not the kernel
;	should use a small screen version of SysNotify.  For
;	devices with low resolutions, this keeps a system
;	notify box on screen and readable.
;
;  HARDWARE_RTC_SUPPORT : Indicates if hardware exists on the
;	machine to support RTC timers.  On the base PC this
;	is not available (usually), but on many machines it is.
;	This is particularly useful for machine which use power
;	management, as the RTC continues to function (usually)
;	when we are in a suspended state, but our software RTC
;	does not.
;
;  HARDWARE_TIMER_8253 : Defines whether or not the kernel will
;	use code specific to Intel's 8253 Programable Timer, or
;	some other code specific to the platform.
;
;  HARDWARE_INT_CONTROL_8259 : Defines whether or not the kernel
;	will use code specific to the Intel's 8259 Programmable
;	Interrupt Controller, or some other code specific to the
;	platform.
;
;  HARDWARE_PC_KEYBOARD : Defines whether or not a standard PC
;	keyboard will be available to the platform at all times.
;	For laptops and palmtops where keyboard may not exist,
;	this allows hardware specific considerations to be
;	implemented.
;
;  NO_DOS : Determines whether or not DOS will be running independent of
;	GEOS.  On PDA-type devices, the DOS implementation really only
;	handles DOS file system calls and little else.  This means exiting
;	GEOS and returning to a DOS prompt would be a very bad thing to let
;	a user do (almost no other DOS apps would run and the user would
;	be forced to reset).  If this flag is set, it ensures that GEOS never
;	exits to DOS.
;
;  NO_ACTIONS_UNTIL_OLD_TIMER_RETURNS : prevent handling of GEOS timed
;  	actions until the last handed-off timer interrupt returns. This
;	works around problems with the miniscule stack found in the
;	SystemSoft Card Services timer interrupt handler, where we would
;	overrun the stack processing timed actions on system resume.
;
;  ALLOW_DOS_EXEC : determines whether DOS programs can be run from GEOS.
;	if it's FALSE, DosExec will return ERROR_UNSUPPORTED_FUNCTION and
;	nothing will be allowed to run a DOS program. This was intended to
;	allow us to pay a lower royalty to DataLight, as it was originally
;	$.25/unit if DOS programs couldn't be run and $.75/unit if they
;	could...
;
;  KERNEL_IN_HMA : if TRUE, kcode resides at segment ffffh. This has
;  	repercussions every place that MAX_SEGMENT or SIG_NON_MEM is used
;	to decide if a handle is a memory handle, as kcode's handle will
;	have an HM_addr such that its HG_type is >= SIG_NON_MEM, making it
;	appear to be a non-memory handle. The HMA and NOHMA macros can be
;	used to assemble code based on whether this flag is TRUE or FALSE
;
;  MOTIF_COLOR_ONLY_SYSTEM: if TRUE, we'll assume the system is color-only, and
;	the UI is motiflike, so we can draw a nicer error box.   This
;	nicer dialog box also requires that the kernel is xip'ed, as it
;	calls kernel discardable resources, which is not good in a fatal error
;	situation.
;
;	1/26/99 ayuen: Actually, I can't find any movable code being called
;	when the MOTIF_COLOR_ONLY_SYSTEM code draws its graphics.  So it
;	should also work in non-XIP as-is.  But anyway, just to be safe, the
;	code is now modified in non-XIP to explicitly call into video driver
;	fixed code instead of via GrDrawXXX/GrFillXXX.  As a result,
;	MOTIF_COLOR_ONLY_SYSTEM can now be used in non-XIP as well.
;
;  DO_NOT_ANNOUNCE_UNNAMED_DISKS: if TRUE, we don't put up the dialog box
; 	saying that we're calling
;
;  NO_FULL_SWAPFILE_NOTIFICATION: if TRUE, we won't warn the user when the
;	swapfile fills up.   Good for very small swapfiles, where it can
;	briefly fill up at any time, before GEOS starts to discard resources
;	from memory.
;
;  SYSTEM_SHUTDOWN_CHAR: key char to cause a system shutdown, usually 
;	VC_SYSTEM_RESET (ctrl-alt-delete).
;
;  NO_ABORT_IN_INSERT_DISK_DIALOG:  don't allow aborting for insert disk
; 	dialog.  This is done because it can cause lots of crash situations,
; 	and used in Redwood for that reason.  Unfortunately, removing abort
;	gives the user no options, and is good as a crash if you don't have
;	the disk to insert.
;
;  VG230_COMMON: set to TRUE is running on Vadem's VG-230 core.  This
;	seemed like a good idea since we've done two products based on
;	this hardware, and might very well do more...
;
;  STANDARD_EXCEPTION_HANDLING   exception handling is the same as on
;  	the "normal" PC
;
;  VG230_FULL_XIP: Set to true if doing full-XIP on a VG230 system.
;	If this flag is set, make sure that the full-XIP image is created
;	with the "-v" option.
;
;  PRINT_FILE_COPY_BUFFER set to true mainly only for DWP machines
;  	that have printer hardware, and thus, a large dedicated RAM
;  	buffer, built in. Since these machines generally don't allow
;  	disk accesses and printing simultaneously, this large buffer
;  	can also be used for file copy operations.
;
;  VM_COMPACT_OFTEN set to TRUE moves the compaction threshold from
; 	70 to 90.  This means VM files get compacted more often (taking
;	time), but use significantly less space (saving, well, space).
;
;  FAULT_IN_EXECUTABLES_ON_FLOPPIES causes all resources of executables
;	on removable media to be faulted in on load
;
;  NO_PEN_SUPPORT set to TRUE nukes the ~3K of pen code - used on systems
;  that do not require pen support
;
;  VM_COMPACT_ON_UPDATE set to TRUE causes VM compaction to occur during
;	VMUpdate.  If FALSE, there is the potential that compacted space
;	won't actually be removed, leaving the file size unchanged.
;
;  IDLE_UPDATE_ASYNC_VM set to TRUE causes the scrub thread to be instructed
;	to VMUpdate an asynchronous-update VM file when one of its blocks gets
;	written out. This (a) reduces the vulnerability of async vm files,
;	as they get updated soon after being made invalid, and (b) makes
;	the heap easier to handle by making all the blocks of the file be
;	discardable.
;
;  CONSUME_INPUT_IF_SCREEN_SAVER_ACTIVE set to true to discard any input
;	used to unblank the screen.  See CombineInputMonitor.
;
;  SYS_NOTIFY_USE_REBOOT_IF_RESTART set to TRUE to map SST_RESTART to
;  	SST_REBOOT in SysNotify. Restart usually fails when there is an
;  	emergency. See SysNotify.
;
;  SYS_NOTIFY_REBOOT_ON_EXIT set to TRUE to reboot system instead of
;	exiting to DOS when the user chooses Exit in SysNotify. This allows
;	systems to still exit to DOS on a clean exit initiated by
;	SysShutdown.
;
;  BACKUP_AND_RESTORE_INI_FILE set to TRUE if you want to validate the
;       .INI file on each bootup and store a backup copy if the .INI file is
;       OK, and restore from that backup copy the .ini is trashed somehow.
;
;  SINGLE_STEP_PROFILING set to TRUE if you want to use the single-step
;       profiling kernel. This requires some obscene amount of memory,
;       though.
;
;  COMPRESSED_XIP set to TRUE if you want to use a compressed XIP image.
;	A compressed XIP image can be created by passing the -c flag to
;	fullxip.  fullxip will then compress all writable and non-code-
;	non-fixed resources.  You must also create and use a COMPRESSED_XIP
;	version of Loader.
;
;  COMPRESSED_VM set to TRUE if you want compressed VM files.  If you use
;	this, you should also set VM_COMPACT_ON_UPDATE to TRUE as well.
;	Otherwise, some VM files may contain a lot of empty space.
;
;  PRIMARY_FSD_FOUND_IN_INTIFILE set to TRUE if you want to make the loading
;	of the primary fs driver based on an .ini file setting rather than
;	the value of 'ver' returned by dos.
;
;  AUTO_SEARCH_FOR_SECONDARIES set to TRUE if you want the kernel to look
;	network and cdrom fs drivers even if they aren't specified in the
;	.ini file (good for demos, bad for devices)
;
;  NO_REPROGRAMMABLE_TIMERS set to TRUE if you don't want the kernel to try
;	and reprogram the timer for msec timers. (They'll occur at the next
;	tick instead.
;
;  NEVER_ENFORCE_HEAPSPACE_LIMITS set to TRUE if you never use
;	[heapspace]/heapSpaceLimitsEnforced = true.  This will exclude
;	heapspace management code both to avoid locking down core blocks and
;	allocating handles (which happen even when [heapspace]/
;	heapSpaceLimitsEnforced is set to false), and to reduce code size.
;
;  USE_32BIT_STRING_INSTR set to TRUE if you want the heap code to use 32-bit
;	string instructions, so that moving memory is faster.  This requires
;	386 processors or above, and it won't actually speed things up on
;	processors that have 16-bit data bus (e.g. 386SX, 486GX.)
;	(NOTE: the code does not check what type of processor it is actually
;	running on, so it will crash horribly on 286 processors or below.)
;
;  SUPPORE_32BIT_DATA_REGS set to TRUE if you want the kernel to save 32-bit
;	registers as well as FS and GS during context-switching, so that
;	geodes can be written to use 32-bit registers to make code smaller
;	and faster.  This requires 386 processors or above.
;	(NOTE: the code does not check what type of processor it is actually
;	running on, so it will crash horribly on 286 processors or below.)
;
;	NOTE: This feature is set in Internal/product.def instead of in this
;	file, because Internal/heapInt.def needs to use this constant, which
;	is in turn because ThreadBlockState is public API for some reason.
;	Sigh.
