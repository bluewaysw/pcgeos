bitMap is high bits tall, and wide bits wide, but wide is rounded up to
a long.  The actual bitmap width is xMax - xMin. xMin and yMin represent the
rounded integer value of the minimum 26.6 coordinate, but j.5 is rounded down
to j rather than up to j+1.  xMax and yMax represent the rounded up integer
value of the maximum 26.6 coordinat, and j.5 does round up to j+1.  The actual
pixel center scan lines that are represented in the bitmap are xMin ... xMax-1
and yMin...to ...yMax-1.

nYchanges is the total number of times that all of the contours in a glyph
changed y direction.  It is always an even number, and represents the maximum
number of times that a row scan line can intersect the glyph. Similarly,
nXchanges is the total number of x direction changes.

yLines is an array of arrays. Each array corresoponds to one row scan line.
Each array is nYchanges+2 entries long. The 0th entry contains the number of
times that row intersects the glyph contours in an On Transition and then the
pixel columns where the intersections occur. These intersections are sorted
from left to right. The last entry contains the number of OFF transition
intersections, and the immediately preceding entries contain the pixel column
numbers where the intersections occur.  These are also sorted from left to
right. yBase is an array of pointers; each pointer pointing to one of the
arrays in yLines.

Similarly, xLines and xBase describe the intersection of column scan lines with
the glyph conotours.  These arrays are only used to fix dropouts.
