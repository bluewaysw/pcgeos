;
;	Note that during system intialization, the ownership of a drive
;	may change several times as more-specialized drivers are loaded. This
;	means the recipient should not be surprised if it's told a drive
;	has been created that it thought already existed.
;
; Context:	Sent through the GCNSLT_FILE_SYSTEM GCNList.
; Source:	The kernel issues this notification whenever a filesystem
;		driver creates or destroys a drive it manages. This includes
;		when a specialized filesystem driver takes control of an
;		existing drive.
; Destination:  Any object that has added itself to the GCNSLT_FILE_SYSTEM
;		GCNList. It is intended for system objects, such as GeoManager

; Source:	The UI issues this notification whenever a Express Menu Control

; Destination:  Any object that has added itself to the

;
;     Any object receiving this message *must* call SysShutdown, passing

;     
;     Once the object has received a response from the user, either
;     affirmative or negative, it must call SysShutdown, passing
