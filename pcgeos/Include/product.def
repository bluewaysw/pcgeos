DESCRIPTION:
	Defines macros used to differentiate between various builds
	and products based on the common PC/GEOS source tree.
	To make full use of this header, define an environment flag
	PRODUCT=<X> and add an entry in Tools/scripts/perl/product_flags
	to map your product into the proper flags to pass to the
	compilation tools.  This file may have to be split into separate 
	Internal/product<X>.def files at some later date.

COMMENT @%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%
		FeatureFlag
%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%%

SYNOPSIS:	Only sets the product feature flag if it isn't set already.
		This provides a handy way to make sure flags defined 
		globally aren't overwritten while allowing custom
		compilation flags to set non-product related features 
		in one's local.mk. 

PASS:		feature_flag	= PRODUCT_FEATURE_FLAG
		value		= TRUE | FALSE | 0 | 1 | -1

PSEUDO CODE/STRATEGY:
KNOWN BUGS/SIDE EFFECTS/IDEAS:
	Could add auto-handling of local.mk -DFEATURE_ flags by adding:
		ifdef FEATURE_feature_flag
		  feature_flag = TRUE
		else	
		  feature_flag = value
		endif
