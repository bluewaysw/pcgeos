;
; NOTE:  If you change the constant here, be sure to update the same constant

UIInterfaceLevel	etype	word
	UIIL_INTRODUCTORY			enum	UIInterfaceLevel
	; This level is designed for the first-time user, or those who just
	; use computers infrequently.  Complex models & all but the most basic
	; features are shunned in favor of metaphors & functionality that is
	; easy to grasp.  Ease of learning and the absence of anything that
	; isn't immediately obvious are the most important considerations
	; of interfaces presented at this level, with a focus towards
	; providing a pleasant experience.  Ease of quick results is very
	; important, however prefabricated & limited in scope (remember
	; PrintShop?).
	;
	; Default behavior:
	; In this mode, the UI protects the user from the concepts of
	; "running" applications & "open" documents by letting them just
	; switch to whatever application & document they wish to use.  The
	; UI takes care of managing the running status of applications &
	; open status of documents transparently, in the background.
	; Apps generally come up maximized, and have no window controls
	; whatsoever (the exception here is desk accessories, which float
	; on top and may be moved & dismissed by the user).  Only one 
	; document at a time may be worked on, & it generally appears in
	; a display which is perminantly maximized.  Applications where
	; the user typically uses only one data file (Address book) won't
	; have a "File" menu at all.  Applications designed for creation of
	; new files will have only "New..." & "Switch to..." options, & will
	; automatically fetch & place files in a single directory.  Kbd
	; shorcuts & mnemonic navigation are turned off (excepting kbd only
	; systems) Application menu structures in general are kept to a minimum,
	; & advanced features are kept completely hidden, not even accessible
	; through the "Options" menu.

	UIIL_BEGINNING	enum	UIInterfaceLevel
	; This level is designed for those who feel comfortable with the
	; basic operation of their computer, how it works, what modules
	; exist within it, etc. & wish to gain access to more of its 
	; capability, or need to solve a particular problem or need for
	; something other than a canned solution.  This level adds in a number
	; of useful features to UI-provided menus, & results in applications
	; offering "options" to turn on all but the most advanced or short-cut
	; oriented capabilities within them. Ease of Learning remains the most
	; important aspect of the interface, & probability of successful
	; usage the most important goal.  We're trying to get the user to be
	; able to actually *accomplish* things here, all on their own, with
	; a low risk of failure.  Time to task completion is not an issue so
	; long as the user is able to figure out what the model is, how to use
	; it, & is able to actually complete whatever it is they're trying to
	; do.  This may be accomplished via more verbose, or scripted dialogs,
	; as opposed to the "set everything at once" type of dialogs seen
	; at higher levels.  The computer should detect abnormal or
	; dangerous situations & help the user to avoid costly mistakes.
	; Dangerous actions should be undoable.  Options that trade
	; performance against safety or recoverability will be tilted
	; towards recoverability.
	;
	; Default behavior:
	; In this mode, the document control adds "New..", "Switch to...", 
	; "Quick Backup", & variety of other capabilities.  Applications
	; offer a way to access most of their features.  The app launch &
	; document models remain "transparent".  Apps continue to run
	; full-screen.  Files created by the user remain in one directory.
	;

	UIIL_INTERMEDIATE	enum	UIInterfaceLevel
	; This level is designed for people familiar with the capabilities
	; of the software, & who are now willing to learn a few things that
	; might not otherwise be obvious in order to speed up their ability
	; to get things done.
	;
	; Default behavior:
	; Here we introduce the user to the concepts of "running apps" &
	; "open documents", & adds in easy to understand "power" features
	; that makes it easier to get things done.  The user must open &
	; close apps & docs to manage accessibility & performance.  App
	; windows start out overlapping (except on machines w/small screens)
	; Adds window min/max/restore capability, pinned menus.  Systems
	; with both mice & keyboards get kbd accelerators & mnemonic
	; navigation.  The system allows only one instance of any given
	; app to be running, but allows multiple documents to be open within
	; that app.

	UIIL_ADVANCED			enum	UIInterfaceLevel
	; This level is designed for the people who use their computer day in,
	; day out, and know PC/GEOS like the back of their hand.  All the
	; bells & whistles available are offered here, though still organized 
	; intelligently with the degree of accessibility set by the user --
	; a technical writer may live in his Word Processor, for instance, but
	; venture into other applications only infrequently -- they shouldn't
	; all look like the cockpits of 727's.  A reduction in the number
	; of steps necessary to complete common tasks, & the speed in which
	; this can be done becomes very important.  The key phrases here
	; are "powerful", "well designed", and "intelligent".
	;
	; Default behavior:
	; The UI offers the possibility of multiple instances of a given app,
	; dialog-clarified.  The notion of hierarchical storage of document
	; files is introduced.
	; 

	UIIL_GURU			enum	UIInterfaceLevel
	; Same as "UIIL_ADVANCED" level, but minus protective warning dialogs
	; that might be annoying to someone who never makes mistakes. :)
	; Options that trade performance against safety or recoverability are
	; tilted towards performance.

MSG_META_CONTENT_VIEW_WIN_OPENED			method	MetaUIMessages
;
; This method is sent whenever a new view has been created, or when a new
; content is attached to a view.  This allows an application to keep
; track of all the open views.  This event will be received BEFORE the
; first MSG_META_EXPOSED is sent out, but the view window may or may
; not be mapped, so drawing should not be done in response to this event.
; Only applciations that keep a record of active view windows need to
; respond to this event.  The companion to this message is
; MSG_META_CONTENT_VIEW_WIN_CLOSED.  This message is sent AFTER MSG_META_-
; CONTENT_VIEW_OPENING when the view is coming up for the first time.
;
; Context:	This will be sent to a content as it is being
;		prepared to appear onscreen.  It will be sent: a) as a view
;		is being made visible, or b) as a view is switching contents.
; Source:	the content's GenView object
; Destination:  a content object, either a process, or a VisContent or subclass
; Interception: A process may want to intercept this and save away the window
;		handle passed.
;
; Pass:		cx - width of view, in document coords
;		dx - height of view, in document coords
;		bp - handle of view window created
; Return:	none
; 		ax, cx, dx, bp - destroyed
;

MSG_META_CONTENT_VIEW_WIN_CLOSED			method	MetaUIMessages
;
; This method is sent immediately after a view's window has been closed, or
; when a content is removed from a view, to let the content know that it
; should no longer maintain any references to this window.  The message is
; guaranteed to be sent to the content AFTER the last MSG_META_EXPOSED for
; that window is sent to the content.  If the content is keeping a
; window handle at this time, it should zero it now.  (The VisContent and
; VisContent objects do this.)  Note that while the Window may be "closed", it
; may not yet be freed, as this does not happen until all window-related
; messages have been flushed through the input queues (such as
; MSG_META_IMPLIED_WIN_CHANGE, MSG_META_RAW_UNIV_ENTER,
; MSG_META_RAW_UNIV_LEAVE).  The companion to this message is
; MSG_META_CONTENT_VIEW_WIN_OPENED.
;
; Context:	This will be sent to a content as it is being removed
;		from the screen.  It will be sent: a) as a view is being
;		made not visible, or b) as a view is switching contents.
; Source:	the content's GenView object
; Destination:  a content object, either a process, or a VisContent or subclass
; Interception: A process may want to intercept this and remove references
;		to the view window handle.

MSG_META_CONTENT_VIEW_ORIGIN_CHANGED			method	MetaUIMessages
;
; This method is sent to indicate the current origin of the view window.
; It will be sent when a content is being used for the first time so it gets 
; the initial value, and on any subsequent changes of that value.
;
; Context:	This will be sent to a content immediately following a 
;		MSG_META_CONTENT_SET_VIEW as the content is being
;		prepared to appear onscreen.  It will be sent: a) as a view
;		is being made visible, or b) as a view is switching contents.
;		It is also sent on any subsequent changes of the origin.
; Source:	the content's GenView object
; Destination:  a content object, either a process, or a VisContent or subclass
; Interception: A content may wish to subclass this and keep track of the 
;		current view origin, or for complicated documents, to ensure 
;		that everything now currently visible in the view window can 
;		be drawn correctly.
;
; Pass:		ss:bp -- {OriginChangedParams} new origin

MSG_META_CONTENT_VIEW_SCALE_FACTOR_CHANGED		method	MetaUIMessages
;
; This method is sent whenever a view window has changed scale factors.
; Also when a content is being used for the first time so it gets the initial
; value.  The content need not do anything with this method if it doesn't
; want to.  This message will precede any MSG_META_EXPOSED message resulting
; from the scale factor changing, but the actual scale factor in the window
; will be indeterminate at time this message arrives.
;
; Context:	This will be sent to a content immediately following a 
;		MSG_META_CONTENT_SET_VIEW as the content is being
;		prepared to appear onscreen.  It will be sent: a) as a view
;		is being made visible, or b) as a view is switching contents.
;		It is also sent on any subsequent changes of the origin.
; Source:	the content's GenView object
; Destination:  a content object, either a process, or a VisContent or subclass
; Interception: A content may wish to subclass this and keep track of the 
;		current scale factor, or for complicated documents, to ensure

;

MSG_META_CONTENT_VIEW_SIZE_CHANGED			method	MetaUIMessages
;
; This method is sent whenever the size of the visible document area changes, 
; notifying the content of the new size.    This message will precede any
; MSG_META_EXPOSED resulting from the size change.  The window will have been
; sized (via a WinResize) by the time this message is handled, so you can
; call WinGetWinScreenBounds to get the real window size, for instance.
;
; Context:	This will be sent out on any change in size of the view window
;		in document coordinates, either from a resize of the view or
;		a change in the view's scale factor.
; Source:	the content's GenView object
; Destination:  a content object, either a process, or a VisContent or subclass
; Interception: A content may wish to subclass this and keep track of the 
;		current view size, or for complicated documents, to ensure 
;		that everything now currently visible in the view window can 
;		be drawn correctly.  Also useful for contents who change their
;		document size based on the size of the visible area (e.g.
;		the notepad, where the height of the document is dependent
;		on the width.)
;
; Pass:		bp - handle of pane window
;		cx - new window width, in document coords (you will have to
;		     call WinGetWinScreenBounds to get the true size of the 
;		     window area in screen coordinates, for doing things like
;		     scale to fit.)
;		dx - new window height, in document coords
; Return:	none
; 		ax, cx, dx, bp - destroyed

MSG_META_CONTENT_TRACK_SCROLLING			method	MetaUIMessages
;
; Allows the content to track any scrolling that occurs in the view, and
; optionally changing the scroll amount that is passed.  See the above
; discussion on MSG_META_CONTENT_TRACK_SCROLLING for more info.  Note:  this
; message MUST be handled if GVA_TRACK_SCROLLING is set in the view's 
; attributes!
;
; Context:	Sent out by the view, if GVA_TRACK_SCROLLING is set in the 
;		view's attributes, on initial setting of the view's origin
;		and before any subsquent scroll of the view window is made.
; Source:	the content's GenView object
; Destination:  a content object, either a process, or a VisContent or subclass
; Interception: A content may wish to subclass this and keep track of the 
;		current view origin, or for complicated documents, to ensure 
;		that everything now currently visible in the view window can 
;		be drawn correctly.  It may also wish to change the scroll
;		values to scroll entire objects onscreen, for instance.
;		See MSG_META_CONTENT_TRACK_SCROLLING for more info,
;
; Pass:		ss:bp - TrackScrollingParams
;		dx - size TrackScrollingParams

; Destination:  The content of the view
; Interception: Only if you want to something else when the view loses the

; These paired GAIN/LOSS messages for the Focus, Target, & Model
; hierarchies are sent, always in the order GAINED, then at some 
; point LOST, to objects on the hierarchy.  The GAINED_(APP) message is sent
; only when the object in question, AND all nodes in the hierarchy above
; that object, have gained the exclusive from the node above them, all the
; way up to the application object.  Just grabbing the exclusive from the
; next node up doesn't always guarantee you'll get a GAINED_(APP) message;  the
; node you're grabbing from must have itself received a GAINED_(APP) message but
; not yet the LOST_(APP) message.  Your object will receive the LOST_APP
; message if it has either released the exclusive, or the node from which
; you grabbed the exclusive itself received a LOST_(APP) message.  Now, if
; that weren't confusing enought, there is additionally the GAINED_SYS &
; LOST_SYS messages, which work just like the APP messages, but are more 
; restrictive in that you only gain the SYS_EXCL if your object & all nodes
; above it all the way to the system have the grab from the next node up.
; You will never receive GAINED_SYS_EXCL if you haven't already received the
; APP_EXCL, & you will always lose the SYS_EXCL before the APP_EXCL, if you
; have it.
;
; Context:	Part of the Focus/Target//Model hierarchy & mechanisms.
; Source:	Do NOT send these messages to objects yourself, unless you
;		are implementing or extending the above mechanism.
;		These messages should be sent only by the node object which 
;		is above the object receiving the message. 
;		They are normally generated in the MSG_META_GAINED_XXX_EXCL or
;		MSG_VIS_VUP_ALTER_FTVWC_EXCL handler for the node itself,
;		eminating from the call to FlowGainedExcl or
;		FlowAlterHierarchicalGrab, respectively
; Destination:	Any MetaClass object which has grabbed and not yet released
;		the focus exclusive
; Interception: Generic UI objects, VisTextClass, and all node objects
;		provide default behavior for processing this message.  The
;		messages may be intercepted, but this must done with care,
;		as there are critical code sections in which the hierarchy is
;		mid-transition, i.e. in what would normally be considered 
;		an illegal state.  These periods are from the start of a
;		GAINED method handler to the point where the superclass is
;		called, and from the point that the superclass is called to
;		the end of a LOST method handler.  (The reason for this is
;		simple:  Standard behavior is for the calling node to update
;		its instance data before sending a GAINED message, but
;		after calling a LOST message.)  Anything that may possible
;		result in a change request on the hierarchy involved may *not*
;		be performed during these critical code sections, or a fatal
;		error will result.  If in doubt, call the superclass at the
;		*start* of a GAINED method, & at the *end* of a LOST method
;		handler.  This will ensure that there is no section of code
;		in which hierarchy tampering is off-limits.
