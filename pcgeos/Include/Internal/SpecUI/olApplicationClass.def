DESCRIPTION:
	Definition of OLApplicationClass.


	OLApplication is the OPEN LOOK Application object.  Besides
	being a generic container for other generic objects in the
	application UI, the OL specific version has a major role in
	orchestrating the overall application's interaction with the
	system & in managing the windows under the application.

MSG_OL_APP_NAVIGATE_TO_NEXT_WINDOW	message
;
; Navigation function to move to "Next" window of the application.
; If there is a modal dialog box up, no action is taken.   Otherwise, 
; switch to next available window (see code for details).
;

MSG_OL_APP_DO_DIALOG_RESPONSE		message
;
; Sent to us when a MSG_GEN_APPLICATION_DO_STANDARD_DIALOG finishes.
;

MSG_OL_APP_TIMED_DIALOG_TIMER_EXPIRED	message
;
; Sent to us when a timeout occurs for a
; MSG_GEN_APPLICATION_DO_STANDARD_TIMED_DIALOG.

MSG_OL_APP_START_TIMER		message
;
; Allows an object that has the gadget exclusive to start up a timer for
; whatever purpose it might want.  Application will send a MSG_TIMER_EXPIRED
; to the OD passed.   If at some point the calling object loses the gadget
; exclusive, it MUST call MSG_OL_APP_STOP_TIMER to clear out its timer.
; This is actually a one-shot; it will not cycle continuously.  
;
; Pass:		cx:dx -- OD to send MSG_TIMER_EXPIRED
;		bp    -- number of ticks to wait until sending 
;			 MSG_TIMER_EXPIRED, or zero to use the standard
;			 olGadgetRepeatDelay (set in the .ini file)
;		
; Return:	nothing
;
; (For commented out IM-queue version only:  The calling
; object must also have the active grab, and must handle a MSG_GADGET_
; REPEAT_PRESS method, sending it back to the application object.  It sounds
; complicated but isn't too bad -- see the scrollbar code as an example (avert
; your eyes from the rest of the scrollbar code, though :).
;
	
MSG_OL_APP_STOP_TIMER		message
;
; Turns off the current timer.  Must be sent by the object that started the
; timer if it loses the gadget exclusive.
;
; Pass:		cx:dx -- OD of timer to stop
; Return:	nothing
;
