;
; Some GOLDEN RULES regarding generic trees:
;
;	1. If a generic object is specifically built (As in variant specific
; 	   class has been determined), then all generic parents of the object
;	   must be specifically built as well.  This allows us to optimally
;	   search a tree in order to find all specifically-grown generic
;	   objects within a branch.
;
;	2. An object is considered FULLY USABLE if it is marked as GS_USABLE,
;	   AND all generic parents of the object are marked as GS_USABLE.
;	   An object which is not fully USABLE is not considered to be part
;	   of the interface of the application, & may not appear on-screen.
;	   When an object becomes fully USABLE, its instance data is first
;	   shrunk back so that it is not specifically grown, to ensure that
;	   as it is rebuilt & incorporated into the UI of the application,
;	   ONLY the generic instance data & position in the generic tree is
;	   used to determine what specific class it should become, & what its
;	   attributes will be
;
;	3. Any generic branch which is NOT FULLY USABLE must NOT be visibly
;	   built.  This rule is temporarily ignored within the handling of
;	   MSG_GEN_SET_NOT_USABLE, where the object is marked as NOT_USABLE,
;	   and THEN visibly closed & unbuilt.  This is the only allowed
;	   exception.

;-------------------------------------------------
;		State query and setting
;-------------------------------------------------
;
; GENERAL:
;
; All state setting methods first call the specific UI.  If the specific
; UI wants to implement the method, it does so and returns the carry set.
; The generic action is generally to set the given state and send a
; MSG_VIS_DRAW or MSG_VIS_VUP_UPDATE_WIN_GROUP to the object.

MSG_GEN_SET_ENABLED				message
;
; Enables a generic object, so that the user may interact with it.
; Objects are enabled by default, until they receive a
; MSG_GEN_SET_NOT_ENABLED.  Disabled object do not respond to the mouse, 
; & are typically drawn "grayed out" by the specific UI.
;
; This method is guaranteed NOT to force the specific building of any object
;
; Context:	Utility message sent to set GenClass object enabled
; Source:	Anyone
; Destination:	Any GenClass object
; Interception:	Generally not intercepted, though the specific UI may have
;		a handler.  However, custom gadgets may handle.  In this
;		case, call superclass if supplementing default functionality
;		else no need to call superclass if replacing default
;		functionality.
;
; Pass:		dl - VisUpdateMode
; Return:	nothing
;		ax, cx, dx, bp - destroyed
;

MSG_GEN_SET_NOT_ENABLED			message
;
; Disables a generic object, so that the user may NOT interact with it.
; Objects are enabled by default, until they receive a
; MSG_GEN_SET_NOT_ENABLED.  Disabled object do not respond to the mouse, 
; & are typically drawn "grayed out" by the specific UI.

MSG_GEN_SET_USABLE		message
;
; A general-purpose methods for setting objects as "USABLE".
; Objects which are not USABLE, or have any generic parents which are
; NOT_USABLE, will not appear as part of the interface for an application.
; Objects may be set USABLE only after they are attached to the system-wide
; generic tree, at which point the object becomes part of the interface for the
; application.  If the window on which the object lies is realized,
; the object will be visually built & updated.
;
; Note that in theory, when a top object of a branch which otherwise
; consists of USABLE object is itself set USABLE, all objects within that
; branch suddenly become USABLE.  This is true for GenPrimarys and GenDisplays.
; However, all dialog GenInteractions will NOT immediately come up on screen,
; but are simply now available to be brought up by the application, using
; MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_INITIATE.  This explains why ALL windows of an
; application don't suddenly pop up on screen when the application object is
; set USABLE on being ATTACHED.  Windows which are in the application object's
; ACTIVE LIST, will, however be made immediately visible by the specific UI
; when the application is ATTACHED.  Thus, any windows you want to be initially
; visible should be listed in the ACTIVE LIST of the app object.
;
; This is a very high-level function, for ALL generic objects except
; GenApplication, GenField, & GenSystem.  The latter three are controlled
; at the highest level using MSG_META_ATTACH & MSG_META_DETACH
; (MSG_GEN_SET_USABLE should NOT be sent to those objects, unless you
; are implementing MSG_META_ATTACH for them in the generic or specific UI)
;
; INSIDER'S NOTE:  The active list concept replaces the simpler, but 
; performance damaging alternative of notifying ALL objects in a branch
; when they become totally USABLE.  You can see that this would be a bad
; idea as the entire interface for an application would have to be loaded
; in on start up, when the top application object is set USABLE as part
; of being ATTACHED.  Of course, this does mean that an object won't be
; informed when it becomes usable, unless it is the top object becoming
; usable.  This works fine for our visual generic objects within a single 
; window, as the MSG_SPEC_BUILD_BRANCH gets sent recursively down the
; tree, informing all objects to become visible, & this suffices to let the
; objects know that they are coming alive.  It also doesn't hurt windowed
; generic objects below this point, for their first need of the knowledge
; that they are USABLE is when they receive the
; MSG_GEN_INTERACTION_INITIATE.   Should new, non-visual generic object types
; be created which need to know when they are USABLE, some equivalent 
; mechanism to the SPEC_BUILD one will have to be created for the groups
; which they are in.
;
; This method DOES force the specific building of the object, but ONLY in the
; case that all generic parents up the tree are also marked as USABLE.
;
; Context:	Utility message sent to set GenClass object usable.  This is
;		the primary mechanism for activating generic objects that have
;		been added or are already part of your application's generic
;		object tree.

MSG_GEN_SET_NOT_USABLE			message
;
; Set object as being not usable.  If hooked into generic tree
; that is visualized, will have to be visually unbuilt & updated
;
; This is a very high-level function, for ALL generic objects
; except GenApplication, GenField, & GenSystem.  The latter
; three are controlled at the highest level using MSG_META_ATTACH
; & MSG_META_DETACH (MSG_GEN_SET_NOT_USABLE should NOT be sent
; to those objects, unless you are implementing part of
; MSG_META_DETACH for them)
;
; This method DOES force the specific building of the object, but ONLY in the
; case that the object & all generic parents up the tree were marked as
; USABLE before this method call (i.e. the object was FULLY USABLE).
;
; WHO CAN USE:	Application, Specific UI only for gen objects it creates.
; 		The single exception is for the Application object, which
; 		the specific UI controls with this routine
;
; Context:	Utility message sent to set GenClass object not usable
; Source:	Anyone
; Destination:	Any GenClass object EXCEPT GenApplication, GenField, and
;		GenSystem (these are controlled by MSG_META_ATTACH and MSG_META_DETACH)
; Interception:	Generally not intercepted, though the specific UI may have

;		case, call superclass if supplementing default functionality
;		else no need to call superclass if replacing default
;		functionality.
;
; Pass:		dl - VisUpdateMode (VUM_MANUAL NOT ALLOWED)
; Return:	nothing
;		ax, cx, dx, bp - destroyed
;
; VUM_MANUAL has been outlawed with a FATAL_ERROR for the same reason that there
; is a warning in MSG_GEN_UPDATE_VISUAL about needing to send a
; MSG_GEN_UPDATE_VISUAL to EVERY generic object you've marked as needing
; visual updating via VUM_MANUAL.  The problem is this:
; An application should make no assumption
; about the visual construction of a generic tree; in other words, if you
; mark two triggers as IMAGE_INVALID, you shouldn't assume that you can
; just update the display that they are on, since the buttons may visually
; be placed on some window other than the display.  This problem is solved
; by having the MSG_GEN_UPDATE_VISUAL, since the specific UI can implement
; this method by invalidating all visual aspects of the object wherever
; (as in whatever window they're in) they may be.  Whew!
;
; So, how does this relate to VUM_MANUAL & MSG_GEN_SET_NOT_USABLE?  Well,
; when an object is marked not usable, it is visually torn down, & may actually
; have the visible instance data discarded.  In this state,
; MSG_GEN_UPDATE_VISUAL does nothing, since the object isn't specifically built.
; 
; How to get around this?  I'd recommend using one of the
; VUM_DELAYED_VIA_??_QUEUE modes for these calls, if you're trying to avoid
; flickering of your display in bringing down UI components.  Note that
; calling multiple MSG_GEN_SET_NOT_USABLE's w/ a DELAYED update mode only
; generates one method which goes through the queue to perform the udpate later.

;		Visual monikers
;-------------------------------------------------
;
; GENERAL:
;
; A visual moniker is the visual representation of an object.  A visual moniker
; is either a text string of a graphics string (while a text string can be a
; type of graphics string, it is useful to make the distinction between the
; two).  See Include/Objects/visC.def for more information about visual
; monikers.
;
; GenClass provides storage of an object's visual moniker and several methods
; to manipulate visual monikers.

MSG_GEN_GET_VIS_MONIKER			message

MSG_GEN_REPLACE_VIS_MONIKER			message
;
; Replaces the visual moniker of an object.  New visual moniker is created from
; either a complete visual moniker, a visual moniker list, a text string, a
; graphics string, or a token.db token.  The source may be referenced by either
; a far pointer, a global heap block handle, or an optr.
;
; MSG_GEN_REPLACE_VIS_MONIKER always creates a new Visual Moniker chunk and
; points the GI_visMoniker field at the new moniker.  Because the old visual
; moniker is overwritten, the object is visually updated.  The VisUpdateMode
; passed determines how this visual update occurs.
;
; When a text string or a gstring is passed, a visual moniker structure will be
; created for the text string or gstring.
;
; Both the object and visual moniker chunk are marked as dirty (ObjSetFlags may
; be used to undo, if necessary).
;
; If a moniker list is passed to this message, and the destination object is
; specifically resolved, the appropriate moniker based on the DisplayScheme of
; the application object and specific UI preferences will be set for the object.
; If the object is not specifically resolved yet, the source moniker list will
; replace the object's current visual moniker.  A moniker is selected from the
; moniker list when the object is specifically resolved.  You must ensure that
; the monikers in the moniker list will exist at that time.  (If some specific
; moniker in the list is desired, the moniker list can be resolved manually
; with the GenFindMoniker or VisFindMoniker routines.)  When passing a moniker
; list, you must ensure that the moniker list will be relocated when the
; moniker list is resolved.  This can be done with either having the moniker
; list be the moniker for an object that will be relocated, or by relocating
; the moniker list manually with MSG_GEN_RELOC_MONIKER_LIST (or
; GenRelocMonikerList for assembly).
;
; If VMDT_TOKEN is passed to indicate that the source is a GeodeToken, the
; destination object must be usable, as it is the Specific UI who must decide
; which moniker to choose from the moniker list in the Token Database.  It
; chooses based on the current video mode and its internal preferences.  If the
; destination object is not usable, its moniker will be cleared.  Since any
; moniker set via VMDT_TOKEN may be based on video mode, it must not be saved
; and restored to and from state file, as the video mode could be changed
; during that time.  Alternately, the moniker can be reset at each startup.

; (whether specific UI, spooler, import library, etc.), which has optr's
; which need to be changed at creation time initially set to enumerated

; First marker for MSG_GEN_BRANCH_REPLACE_PARAMS(BRPT_OUTPUT_OPTR) to be 
; stored in the output field of a generic object supporting
; MSG_GEN_BRANCH_REPLACE_PARAMS, to be replaced before execution by
; MSG_GEN_BRANCH_REPLACE_PARAMS, or MSG_GEN_BRANCH_REPLACE_OUTPUT_OPTR_CONSTANT,
; which calls MSG_GEN_BRANCH_REPLACE_PARAMS.  If only a single optr needs
; replacing, just use this constant.  If multiple optrs are involved, set up
; an enumerated type, beginning at this number. Store those constants in the
; destination fields of the objects involved, & pass that constant as
; the "source" constant to MSG_GEN_BRANCH_REPLACE_PARAMS/
; MSG_GEN_BRANCH_REPLACE_OUTPUT_OPTR_CONSTANT.
;
; NOTE that TravelOptions (see MSG_META_SEND_CLASSED_EVENT) are also stored
; as enumerated constants in the optr, & in fact is the default interpretation
; where the handle of the optr is 0.  Because of this:
;
;	1) Don't use TravelOptions in any branch where optrs are going to
;	   be fixed up using MSG_GEN_BRANCH_REPLACE_OUTPUT_OPTR_CONSTANT/
;	   MSG_GEN_BRANCH_REPLACE_PARAMS, & visa versa.  You must choose one
;	   or the other approach.
;
;	2) MSG_GEN_BRANCH_REPLACE_OUTPUT_OPTR_CONSTANT/
;	   MSG_GEN_BRANCH_REPLACE_PARAMS *must* be called on a generic tree
;	   before anything else is done to is, so that its objects don't
;	   try to send something out the dummy optr, which is often a legal
;	   destination because of the incorrect interpretation as being
;	   a TravelOption.  "0" in the handle, & "1" in the chunk is
;	   interpreted as "TO_SELF", for example, so an optr stuffed with
;	   the replace constant BRP_DUMMY_OPTR_START if not replaced right

;
; This method may be used to determine the current target (window/object
; etc.) below a certain point in the target hierarchy.
; From any node in the hierarchy, you may ask for the current object
; at any node lower down in the hierarchy.  Since the hierarchy
; "remembers" the child at each node, even if that branch of the
; heierarch is not active, you can still determine, for instance, which object
; in an application has the target within that application, even if the
; application itself does not have the focus.
;
; (Needs to be MetaUIMessages as can be sent to both Gen and Vis objects)
;
; This method may be sent to any of the following generic objects, to
; determine the current target below that point:
; GenSystem, GenField, GenApplication, GenPrimary, GenDisplayGroup,
; GenDisplay, GenView (if isolated), GenContent (if isolated)
;
; & the following Visible objects:  VisContent
;
; Pass:		cx	- TargetLevel  -- Set to TL_TARGET for basic
;			  lookup of the current target, or use one

;
; Return:	^lcx:dx - current object within application.
;		ax:bp 	- Class of target object being returned
;
; Since this is normally subclassed to ADD behavior, be sure to call
; superclass.
;
; NOTES ON USAGE:
;
;	1) The class returned  will be the bottom-most subclass in the
;	   class hierarchy for this object.  If you
;	   need to know if the object belongs to one of
;	   the intermediate classes, use  ObjIsObjectInClass to find out.
;
;	2) Targets at the content & lower levels,
;	   when requested via a call from a higher level,
;	   will not be accessible until the content has
;	   been realized (Actually, the UI is updated from within the
;	   content handler for MSG_VIEW_OPENING).
; 	   This is because the content has not had an opportunity
;	   to update the targetInfo data being stored in the View
;	   until that time.
;
;	3) In addition, queries for target across an isolated
;	   View/Content will NOT return synchronous results;
;	   The content must notify the view of the change
;	   in target via a message sent through the UI queue.
;	   It is possible to get slightly out-of-date 
;	   information regarding the current TARGET within
;	   the view (by one message queue's worth of methods)
;	   A method sent directly to the content will always
;	   return correct & synchronous information.
;
;	4) If you have an isolated View, and are not using a VisContent
;	   or subclass thereof as the content, then you will need
;	   to keep the View up to date with current target information
;	   within the content, using MSG_VIEW_UPDATE_CONTENT_TARGET_INFO
;	   (documented in visClass.asm)

;
; These aren't actually used by GenClass, but handlers and definitions exist
; here to make the use of these things by generic objects (e.g. the file
; selector and document control) as easy as possible.
;
; Because handlers for all these messages are implemented in GenClass, it is
; possible to store a path with any generic object, whether the particular
; object normally does anything with the filesystem or not. For example, you
; could subclass GenTrigger and store a path with it that your subclass would
; then use.
;
; The path itself is stored in the object's vardata under the tag
; ATTR_GEN_PATH_DATA. In the absence of such an attribute, GenClass will
; default the path to SP_TOP, should anyone ask it. Subclasses can change this
; default by intercepting MSG_META_INITIALIZE_VAR_DATA, filling in the
; GenFilePath structure after it has called the superclass (which will actually
; allocate the attribute).

; one block.  The block is freed.  The object called with this message
; must be the only top object in the block.  Called by UserDestroyDialog.
; Implementation:  If any object within the block resides on the application
; active list, or the object is not a window, the slow, non-optimized
; approach is taken:  The branch is set NOT_USABLE(VUM NOW), removed from the
; generic tree, & sent MSG_META_BLOCK_FREE.
; If no object of the block can be found on this list, an optimized approach
; is taken:  The window is taken off the screen, FTVMC, mouse, etc
; exclusives released, the linkage changed to be one-way upward, & the
; block sent MSG_META_BLOCK_FREE.  In other words, the whole unbuild process
; is carefully avoided.

;	Hints for a GenClass object

HINT_DUMMY			vardata
			; Just what it says.  This hint will never do anything,

			;this marks the button as being the default button
			;for this window. Pressing ENTER will trigger the
			;default button, even if the selection cursor is on

HINT_ENSURE_TEMPORARY_DEFAULT	vardata
			;this allows a gadget (such as a GenTrigger) to get
			;the temporary default exclusive when it has the FOCUS,
			;even in situations where the specific UI thinks not.
			;(Example: in Motif, a trigger that is in a summons

;
HINT_ALLOW_CHILDREN_TO_WRAP		vardata
	;Let children wrap if the generic composite is too long to fit its
	;children inside its generic parent, typically as a result of a user
	;resize, desired size specification by the programmer, or an effort
	;by the UI to keep a window fully onscreen.
	
HINT_BOTTOM_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN		vardata
	;Bottom justifies an object's children.  In a horizontal composite,
	;causes an objects children to line up their bottom edges.  In a 
	;vertical composite, this positions the children at the bottom of the
	;composite, usually in conjunction with HINT_EXPAND_HEIGHT_TO_FIT_
	;PARENT.
	
HINT_CENTER_CHILDREN_HORIZONTALLY	vardata
	;Centers a composite's children between the composite's left and right 
	;edges. Works for both vertical and horizontal composites.  In a 
	;horizontal composite, usually used in conjunction with HINT_EXPAND_
	;WIDTH_TO_FIT_PARENT.
	
HINT_CENTER_CHILDREN_ON_MONIKERS	vardata
	;A special centering hint for a vertical composite that contains two
	;or more GenLists or other groups of settings that have their monikers
	;placed on the left side.  Centers children so that right edges of its
	;children's monikers and left edges of its children's first children
	;line up vertically, i.e.:
	;
	;		Fonts:  Mono  Roman  Sans
	;	   Dimensions:  Small  Medium  Large
	;    Save on Shutdown:	Yes  No
	;
	
HINT_CENTER_CHILDREN_VERTICALLY		vardata
	;Centers a composite's children between the composite's top and bottom
	;edges. Works for both vertical and horizontal composites.  In a 
	;vertical composite, usually used in conjunction with HINT_EXPAND_
	;HEIGHT_TO_FIT_PARENT.
					
HINT_CENTER_MONIKER			vardata
	;Directs the UI to center the object's moniker, if applicable.  Often
	;used with GenInteractions in conjunction with HINT_PLACE_MONIKER_
	;ABOVE.  Also can be used in GenTriggers, GenItems, GenBooleans, and
	;GenGlyphs in conjunction with HINT_EXPAND_WIDTH_TO_FIT_PARENT.
	
HINT_CUSTOM_CHILD_SPACING		vardata	SpecSizeSpec
	;For composites, suggest a custom amount of spacing between children.
	;Takes one argument of type SpecSizeSpec.  For example, to have 1 pixel 
	;spacing between children:
	;
	;	HINT_CUSTOM_CHILD_SPACING {
	;		SST_PIXELS | 1
	;	}
	;	
	;To have zero length spacing:	
	;
	;	HINT_CUSTOM_CHILD_SPACING {
	;		SST_PIXELS | 0
	;	}
	;	
	;As with most hints, the specific UI reserves the right to ignore the
	;suggested spacing.
	;
	
HINT_DONT_ALLOW_CHILDREN_TO_WRAP	vardata
	;For objects that might wrap as default behavior, turns off the 
	;behavior so that composites must fit all their children on a single
	;line whether there is room or not.
					
HINT_DONT_FULL_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN		vardata
	;Turns off any full justification that may exist as default behavior
	;for this object.
					
HINT_DONT_INCLUDE_ENDS_IN_CHILD_SPACING	vardata
	;Turns off the use of ends in full justification that may exist as
	;default behavior.
	
HINT_DO_NOT_USE_MONIKER			vardata
	;Suggests that the object's moniker not be displayed, even if it exists.
	;May or may not be supported by a particular UI object, though is 
	;guaranteed to be supported for GenInteraction & GenText classes.
	
HINT_DRAW_IN_BOX			vardata
	;Suggests that the given composite have a border drawn around it, as
	;determined by the specific UI.
	
HINT_EXPAND_HEIGHT_TO_FIT_PARENT	vardata
	;Directs an object to, if possible, expand its height to fill up any	
	;vertical space available in its parent.  Most often used by vertical
	;composites when it is desirable to center, bottom justify, or full
	;justify its children in the available space.  Can also be used in
	;GenTextDisplays or GenTextEdits to expand the object to fill the 
	;available vertical space.
					
HINT_EXPAND_WIDTH_TO_FIT_PARENT		vardata
	;Directs an object to, if possible, expand its width to fill up any	
	;horizontal space available in its parent.  Often used by horizontal
	;composites when it is desirable to center, right justify, or full
	;justify its children in the available space.  Also can be used in
	;GenTriggers, GenListEntries, scrolling GenLists, GenTextDisplays,
	;GenTextEdits, or GenFileSelectors to expand the object to fill the
	;available horizontal space.
	
HINT_FIXED_SIZE				vardata	; XXX
	;Sets a fixed size for a composite or non-composite object.
	;This is most often used to allocate a pre-determined size for an
	;object or group of objects that would otherwise change size often 
	;while onscreen due to moniker changes, children removed or added, etc.
	;The advantage of keeping an object's size fixed is it prevents 
	;the recalculation and redrawing of windows that is required when 
	;various objects change size in the window
	;
	;For non-composites, requires a width argument of type SpecWidth,
	;and an optional height argument of type SpecHeight.  If either 
	;argument is zero, it is ignored. Composite objects require that a third
	;argument of type word also be included for the number of children to 
	;be included in in the composite's size calculations.   The SpecWidth
	;and SpecHeight attributes are either specified in terms of the size
	;of the objects moniker (or the sum of the children's monikers), or
	;a percentage of the size of the screen.
	;
	;For example, to force a GenTrigger to keep a width of 12 average 
	;width characters, you could specify:
	;
	;	HINT_FIXED_SIZE {
	;		SpecWidth <SST_AVG_CHAR_WIDTHS, 12>
	;		SpecHeight <>
	;	}
	;
	;To direct a horizontal GenInteraction to be sized so that the sum
	;of its 5 children's widths can be up to 55 maximum width characters
	;and still fit, you could specify:
	;
	;	HINT_FIXED_SIZE {
	;		SpecWidth <SST_WIDE_CHAR_WIDTHS, 55>
	;		SpecHeight <>
	;		word	5
	;	}
	;
	;Similarly, for a vertical composite to reserve room for 4 GenTriggers:
	;
	;	HINT_FIXED_SIZE {
	;		SpecWidth <>
	;		SpecHeight <SST_LINES_OF_TEXT, 4>
	;		word	4
	;	}
					
HINT_FULL_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN_HORIZONTALLY	vardata
	;Allows a horizontal composite to full justify its children.  Does
	;nothing in a vertical composite.  Nearly always used in conjunction
	;with HINT_EXPAND_WIDTH_TO_FIT_PARENT.
	
HINT_FULL_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN_VERTICALLY	vardata
	;Allows a vertical composite to full justify its children.  Does
	;nothing in a horizontal composite.  Nearly always used in conjunction
	;with HINT_EXPAND_HEIGHT_TO_FIT_PARENT.
	
HINT_INCLUDE_ENDS_IN_CHILD_SPACING	vardata
	;Always used in conjunction with one of the full justify hints.
	;Usually in full justification the available space is divided up and
	;put between the children only.  Adding this hint allows for space
	;to be added before the first child and after the last child as well.
	;Works for both horizontal and vertical composites.
					
HINT_INITIAL_SIZE			vardata	; XXX
	;Specifies an initial size for an object, usually only for when the
	;object appears for the first time, and then only if its possible
	;given other geometry requirements of the object's window.
	;This size will only keep in effect until the window is resized or
	;something else causes the object to be resized.  Arguments are the 
	;same as for HINT_FIXED_SIZE.
					
HINT_LEFT_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN		vardata
	;Left justifies an object's children.  In a vertical composite,
	;causes an objects children to line up their left edges.  In a 
	;horizontal composite, this positions the children towards the left 
	;edge of the composite.  This is typically the default justification of
	;a composite anyway.
					
HINT_LEFT_JUSTIFY_MONIKERS		vardata
	;Used in conjunction with HINT_CENTER_CHILDREN_ON_MONIKERS, allows
	;the children's left monikers to be left justified rather than the
	;default right justification.  An example:
	;
	;Center-on-monikers only:		With both hints:
	;	
	;         Spacing: 1 2 3 4		Spacing:          1 2 3 4
	;Forced Expanding: Yes No		Forced Expanding: Yes No
	;          Center: Vertically		Center:		  Vertically
	;	           Horizontally				  Horizontally
	;
	
HINT_MAKE_REPLY_BAR			vardata
	;Instructs the specific UI to use the appropriate geometry for a
	;reply bar.  Typically for GenInteractions at the bottom of dialog
	;boxes that have buttons like OK, Cancel, etc.
	;
	;NOTE: Normally, reply bars are created automatically by using
	;HINT_SEEK_REPLY_BAR on the object to be placed in the reply bar.
	;If your own reply bar is supplied with HINT_MAKE_REPLY_BAR, all
	;reply bar gadgets must be children of that reply bar.  You cannot
	;have children of the GenInteraction that use HINT_SEEK_REPLY_BAR to
	;place themselves in the reply bar and expect things to work completely
	;correctly (specifically there will be problems with setting your reply
	;bar not usable and usable).
	
HINT_MAXIMUM_SIZE			vardata	; XXX
	;Specifies a desired maximum size for an object.  Most useful for 
	;objects like GenView, GenTextDisplay, and GenText objects,
	;where it can be useful to assign a range of sizes for the 
	;object.  Arguments are the same as for HINT_FIXED_SIZE.
	
HINT_MINIMUM_SIZE			vardata	; XXX
	;Specifies a desired minimum size for an object.  Most useful for 
	;objects like GenView, GenTextDisplay, and GenText objects,
	;where it can be useful to assign a range of sizes for the 
	;object.  Arguments are the same as for HINT_FIXED_SIZE.
	
HINT_NO_TALLER_THAN_CHILDREN_REQUIRE	vardata
	;Designed to turn off any expand-height-to-fit-parent default behavior
	;in an object, if there is any.    The object will only be as high as
	;needed to hold the children, plus the margins.
					
HINT_NO_WIDER_THAN_CHILDREN_REQUIRE	vardata
	;Designed to turn off any expand-width-to-fit-parent default behavior
	;in an object, if there is any.  The object will only be as wide as 
	;needed to hold the children, plus the margins.
					
HINT_ORIENT_CHILDREN_HORIZONTALLY	vardata
	;Orients a composite's children horizontally.  Children are placed from
	;left to right.
	
HINT_ORIENT_CHILDREN_VERTICALLY		vardata
	;Orients a composite's children vertically.  Children are placed from
	;top to bottom.
	
HINT_PLACE_MONIKER_ABOVE		vardata
	;Directs the specific UI to place this object's moniker above the 
	;object's contents, if possible.  Used primarily with plain
	;GenInteractions.  
	
HINT_ALIGN_LEFT_MONIKER_EDGE_WITH_CHILD	vardata		
	;Can be used in tandem with HINT_PLACE_MONIKER_ABOVE to align the
	;the moniker's left edge with that of the first generic child of the
	;object.  This is default behavior in motif, and can be circumvented
	;with any of HINT_PLACE_MONIKER_TO_LEFT, HINT_PLACE_MONIKER_TO_RIGHT,
	;and HINT_CENTER_MONIKER.
	
HINT_PLACE_MONIKER_TO_LEFT		vardata
	;Directs the specific UI to place this object's moniker to the left of
	;the object's contents, if possible.  
	
HINT_PLACE_MONIKER_TO_RIGHT		vardata
	;Directs the specific UI to place this object's moniker to the right of
	;the object's contents, if possible.  
	
HINT_RIGHT_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN		vardata
	;Right justifies a composite's children.  Works for both vertical and 
	;horizontal composites.  In a horizontal composite, will position the 
	;children as close to the composite's right edge as possible, and is
	;almost always used in conjunction with HINT_EXPAND_WIDTH_TO_FIT_PARENT.
	;In a vertical composite, aligns the children's right edges.
	
HINT_TOP_JUSTIFY_CHILDREN		vardata
	;Top justifies an object's children.  In a horizontal composite,
	;causes an objects children to line up their top edges.  In a 
	;vertical composite, this positions the children towards the top
	;edge of the composite.  This is typically the default justification
	;of a composite, anyway.
	
HINT_WRAP_AFTER_CHILD_COUNT		vardata		word
	;When used with HINT_ALLOW_CHILDREN_TO_WRAP, directs a certain number
	;of initial children to go through before forcing the composite to wrap.
	;
	; An example:
	;	HINT_WRAP_AFTER_CHILD_COUNT {
	;		word	3
	;	}
	;	

HINT_DIVIDE_WIDTH_EQUALLY		vardata
	;Instructs a composite object to divide any space it gets for the width
	;equally among the usable children.  Can only suggest the size to the
	;children -- they will decide whether they can expand to fill the
	;suggested space.  Typical children that do well under this hint are
	;GenViews and generic objects that have HINT_EXPAND_WIDTH_TO_FIT_PARENT
	;set.    Has no effect if the composite is vertically oriented.

HINT_DIVIDE_HEIGHT_EQUALLY		vardata
	;Instructs a composite object to divide any space it gets for the height
	;equally among the usable children.  Can only suggest the size to the
	;children -- they will decide whether they can expand to fill the
	;suggested space.  Typical children that do well under this hint are
	;GenViews and generic objects that have HINT_EXPAND_HEIGHT_TO_FIT_PARENT
	;set.  Has no effect if the composite is horizontally oriented.


HINT_NO_BORDERS_ON_MONIKERS		vardata		
	;If available, borders will not be drawn around monikers.    This may
	;or may not be supported by the UI.  Typical use might be triggers with
	;non-rectangular bordered monikers in a custom application area, where
	;a trigger border might not be desired.   In general, this should be
	;used with care, even if the specific UI supports it.
	
TextColors	struc

TextColors	ends

HINT_GADGET_TEXT_COLOR			vardata		TextColors
	;Color to be used for a text moniker in this object, if any
	;This is may or may not be supported by the specific UI.
	;It is most commonly used in toolboxes to have the
	;text color match the primary moniker color of other tools.
	;Though the selected color is usually the same as the unselected color,
	;they can be different, and both must be specified.

HINT_POPS_UP_TO_RIGHT			vardata
	;If this turns into some kind of object that pops up under its
	;activating gadget, have the object pop up to the right instead.

HINT_POPS_UP_BELOW				vardata
	;Like HINT_POPS_UP_TO_RIGHT, but directs the specific UI to have the
	;object pop up below its activation gadget, if possible.

;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

ATTR_GEN_PROPERTY			vardata
	;In a GenObject such as a GenItemGroup, GenValue or GenText, the object
	;will behave like it was in a properties dialog box even if it isn't.
	;It will not automatically apply itself and clear its modified state
	;when the user interacts with the object.   The application can
	;send a MSG_APPLY to it when needed, or query for information and
	;clear its modified state manually.  Note that this is uncommon usage,
	;and shouldn't usually be necessary for well behaved applications.

ATTR_GEN_NOT_PROPERTY			vardata
	;In a GenObject such as a GenItemGroup, GenValue or GenText, the object
	;will behave like it is not in a properties dialog box even if it is.
	;It will automatically apply itself and clear its modified state
	;when the user interacts with the object.   Note that this is uncommon 
	;usage, and shouldn't usually be necessary for well behaved 
	;applications.
					
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
	
;	Command hints for GenTriggers - must be defined at this level
;	to prevent overlaps in the hint numbers.

HINT_SEEK_MENU_BAR		vardata
			;When finding the visible parent for a GenTrigger,
			;this forces the BUILD_INFO query to place the trigger
			;inside a menu bar, even if that is ugly in this UI.

HINT_AVOID_MENU_BAR		vardata
			;When finding the visible parent for a GenTrigger,
			;this prevents the BUILD_INFO query from placing the
			;trigger inside a menu bar, even if that is expected
			;in this specific UI.  It will typically go into some
			;kind of trigger bar instead.


;------------------------------------------------------------------------------
;		Keyboard Navigation Hints
;------------------------------------------------------------------------------

;These two hints allow the field navigation path within a window to make jumps
;between visible objects. You can also supply use these hints on GenInteractions
;which are used to group items within a window, in cases where the children
;can be traversed in visible order, but the parent is out-of-order with
;respect to the rest of the objects in the window. Also note that when
;creating a menu, summons, or command window for which a button will
;be created by the UI, place these hints on the window object. The hints
;given for a windowed object will only be used when navigating in a window
;which contains the button.

HINT_NAVIGATION_ID		vardata	word

	;Use this to specify a word ID value for an object. Example:
	;
	;	HINT_NAVIGATION_ID {
	;	    DefineNavID	MY_OBJECT_ID
	;	}
	;
	;"MY_OBJECT_ID" will be defined to a specific value, and placed inside
	;a define-word directive. This macro is smart enough to avoid conflicts
	;between specific UI and application ID numbers.

HINT_NAVIGATION_NEXT_ID		vardata	word

	;Use this to cause the navigation path to jump to the specified object.
	;Example:
	;
	;	HINT_NAVIGATION_NEXT_ID {
	;	    NavToID	SOME_OBJECT_ID
	;	}
	;
	;A fatal error will be generated if no object with such an ID exists
	;in the window. This is dangerous, because sometimes objects are
	;removed from windows. You can also use:
	;
	;	HINT_NAVIGATION_NEXT_ID {
	;	    NavToNearID SOME_OBJECT_ID
	;	}
	;
	;Which will cause navigation to proceed to the object in the window
	;which has the CLOSEST ID number that is equal or greater than the
	;specified value. If no such ID exists, the visible tree will be used.

;Application note: if you are defining a series of UI objects for a window,
;and want them to be in order in navigation, and each object might be
;arbitrarily removed and replaced, try to keep them as children of the same
;generic parent. This will (hopefully) make them children of the same visible
;parent, and you will not need to use these hints to set up the navigation path.
;The visible tree will be used, and object removals/add won't hurt anything.
;
;If your window is constructed such that these objects are out of order
;in a typical "depth-first" traversal of the visible tree, then you will
;have to use these hints to set up the navigation path to ensure that they
;are reached in order. If you make these links using "NavToID" in the
;hints, and an object is removed from the visible tree, you will get a fatal
;error since that ID cannot be found. The best thing you can do is to define
;these objects in the correct order, and in the same resource in the UI file.
;This will ensure that their ID numbers are increasing in value, and you can
;use the "NavToNearID" in each hints.. That way, if one object is removed,
;the next object take its place in the navigation path.
;
;If you are wierd and must define this objects is random order in the UI
;file, or they are in different resources,  you can still give them
;increasing ID numbers. Place this in your application's constants file:
;	AllocNavID	MY_FIRST_FLAKEY_OBJECT
;	AllocNavID	MY_SECOND_FLAKEY_OBJECT
;	AllocNavID	MY_THIRD_FLAKEY_OBJECT
;
;	And then just use these constants in the HINT_NAVIGATION_ID as follows:
;
;	HINT_NAVIGATION_ID {
;		dw MY_FIRST_FLAKEY_OBJECT
;	}

ATTR_GEN_INIT_FILE_CATEGORY	vardata	char
;
; Category to use for saving the options for this & all objects down the generic

; as AOF_MULTIPLE_INIT_FILE_CATEGORIES=TRUE (in the app obj), or if 
; ATTR_GEN_USES_HIERARCHICAL_INIT_FILE_CATEGORY is set on the starting
; object, will call MSG_META_GET_INI_FILE_CATEGORY on the object itelf to get

; ATTR_GEN_INIT_FILE_CATEGORY.  If neither of the previous mentioned tests
; are met, then the application object is called directly to get the

;

ATTR_GEN_FEATURE_LINK		vardata lptr
;
; This attribute is used with the GenControl mechanism to allow controllers
; to have "features" that map to multiple objects.  The data is the next
; object that is part of the same feature.


HINT_TOOLBOX				vardata
; For GenInteractions, GenPrimaries, GenLists, or GenDisplays.
; Suggests that the object and all objects in the visual hierarchy below it 
; are part of a "toolbox," and should draw themselves appropriately.  
; In Motif, windowed objects with HINT_TOOLBOX will act like pinned menus in
; that when clicked upon, they won't steal the focus away from the window that 
; has it.
  
; These should be moved into geometry section...

HINT_SEEK_REPLY_BAR			vardata
	; This indicates that this object (usually GenTrigger) is a reply bar

	; Motif will place the trigger in the reply bar of the first
	; non-GIT_ORGANIZATIONAL GenInteraction that is a window (either a

; indicate that the handle of the blcok that the object lies in should be
; used as the LayerID.  LayerID's are used by the window system to uniquely
; identify different layers.   Though their actual value has no meaning, the
; convention is to handles owned by the application, to avoid collisions with
; LayerID's being used by other apps.  To use this attribute in UIC, you'll

HINT_SHOW_SHORTCUT			vardata
; This indicates that the keyboard accelerator, if any, for this generic object
; should be drawn if it otherwise wouldn't be drawn (i.e. not in a menu).
; Note that if running in keyboard-only mode, shortcuts will always be drawn
; and if running in no-keyboard mode, shortcuts will never be drawn.  This
; hint is overridden by those modes.  Specifically, HINT_SHOW_SHORTCUT in
; no-keyboard mode will *not* draw the shortcut.

HINT_DRAW_SHORTCUT_BELOW		vardata
; This indicates that the keyboard accelerator, if any is drawn, should be
; drawn below the normal moniker, instead of to the right.  This does not
; override the menu item behavior of drawing any keyboard accelerator to the
; right.
  
HINT_CAN_CLIP_MONIKER_WIDTH		vardata
HINT_CAN_CLIP_MONIKER_HEIGHT		vardata
; Allows objects to clip their monikers if not enough space is provided for

; repeating glyphs to be used as resizable separators, etc.  Currently 
; implemented for the GenGlyph, GenTrigger, GenItem, and GenBoolean.

 
HINT_SHOW_ENTIRE_MONIKER		vardata
; Forces an object to leave enough space to show all its moniker, in case by
; by default an object allows this.



;  
; Advanced hints that will cause a generic object to override its geometry
; manager-chosen position and be positioned elsewhere.  These are should
; generally not be used, especially if you're not clear about what you are

HINT_IF_SYSTEM_ATTRS 	vardata		SystemAttrs
;
; Can be used to conditionally add hint(s) to an object based on certain system
; criteria.  If the flags set in the hint's data are true for the current system
; being run, then the hint or hints that follow are included; otherwise they 
; are deleted for space reasons.   In the absence of a HINT_ENDIF, only the
; succeeding hint is affected.   See HINT_ENDIF for having groups of hints
; included based on system conditions, and HINT_ELSE for alternative hints
; to be included when the conditions are not met.  An example:
;
;	HINT_IF_SYSTEM_ATTRS = SA_NOT | SA_PEN_BASED;
;		HINT_EXPAND_HEIGHT_TO_FIT_PARENT;
;
; Expands an object's height if the system is NOT pen based.

HINT_ENDIF		vardata
;
; Can be used with HINT_IF_SYSTEM_ATTRS to group any number of hints to be

;
;	HINT_IF_SYSTEM_ATTRS = SA_TINY;
;		HINT_MINIMIZE_SIZE;
;		HINT_DISPLAY_CURRENT_SELECTION;
;	HINT_ENDIF;
;
; The two hints between HINT_IF_SYSTEM_ATTRS and HINT_ENDIF will both be 
; removed if the screen is not horizontally or vertically tiny.
;

HINT_ELSE		vardata
;	
; Can be used between HINT_IF_SYSTEM_ATTRS and HINT_ENDIF to allow hints
; that can be included when system conditions are satisfied, and a separate set
; of hints to be included when the system conditions are not satisfied.  For
; example:
;
;	HINT_IF_SYSTEM_ATTRS = SA_HORIZONTALLY_TINY;
;		HINT_ORIENT_CHILDREN_VERTICALLY;
;		HINT_WRAP_AFTER_CHILD_COUNT = 3;
;	HINT_ELSE;

;
; NOTE: If you will have GenDisplays in your app, here are descriptions of how
;	to force various commonly desired effects:
;
;	1) I want a keyboard to be visible only when there is an open
;      	   GenDisplay (this is usually what apps that use the displays to
;	   hold open documents will want).
;
;	   If this is the case, set KO_KEYBOARD_REQUIRED on all GenDisplays
;	   (or KO_KEYBOARD_EMBEDDED on any displays that have embedded
;	   keyboards). 
;
;
;	2) I want a keyboard visible only on certain displays.
;	   (America Online-type app)
;	   
;	   Set the KeyboardOverride enumerated type appropriate to each
;	   display on the display itself. When the last display has closed,
;	   the floating keyboard will come off-screen.
;	   
;	3) I always want a keyboard visible, even if there are no GenDisplays
;	   open.
;
;	   Set KO_KEYBOARD_REQUIRED on the GenPrimary, and add KO_NO_KEYBOARD
;	   on all the GenDisplays before they come on screen
;
;	4) I want to embed a keyboard on my primary, and never allow a floating
;	   keyboard.
;
;	   Set KO_KEYBOARD_EMBEDDED on the GenPrimary, and add KO_NO_KEYBOARD
;	   on all the GenDisplays

ATTR_GEN_WINDOW_KBD_POSITION		vardata	Point

HINT_WINDOW_MINIMIZE_TITLE_BAR			vardata

;
;			*** NOTE ***
; Because this gets rid of the system menu, the window will need to have some
; other means of dismissing itself.
; Also, when a dialog that has no system menu gets disabled the UI will dismiss
; it, so be aware that if this hint is on a dialog disabling it will take it
; off the screen.

HINT_WINDOW_ALWAYS_DRAW_WITH_FOCUS		vardata
