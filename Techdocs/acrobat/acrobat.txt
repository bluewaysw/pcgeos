    This version of the SDK is bundled with its own on-line
    documentation viewer: Adobe Acrobat Reader. This file explains how
    to install the Adobe Acrobat Reader onto your hard disk, how to
    use the Reader to view the documentation, and how the SDK
    documentation in Acrobat format is organized on the SDK disk.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

			WHAT YOU GET

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	The Acrobat Reader package contains the following items:

	    o The Acrobat Reader program
	    o An Acrobat Reader On-line Guide and Acrobat Reader
		Tour
	    o Adobe Type Manager (ATM) software
	    o 14 Adobe Type 1 fonts

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

			SYSTEM REQUIREMENTS

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	To use the Windows version of the Acrobat Reader program, 
	you need:

	    o A 386- or 486-based personal computer
	    o Microsoft Windows 3.1 or later
	    o 4 Megabytes of RAM (8 MB recommended)

		Note: Acrobat Reader does not support the Hercules
		display adapter
	    o A 1.44 MB 3.5-inch floppy disk drive
	    o A hard disk drive with at least 6 MB of free space (or
		5.5 MB of free disk space if you choose not to install
		the tour)
	    o A Postscript printer or other Windows-compatible output
		device 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

		INSTALLING THE ACROBAT READER PROGRAM

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Because Adobe Acrobat Reader is a Windows program, you will
	need to install it while running Windows. For this reason, the
	Reader will not be installed during the basic SDK install.

	The source files for the program are located in the \READER
	directory on the root of the SDK CD-ROM. This directory
	contains two sub-directories, \READER\DISK1 and \READER\ATM.
	
	The installation procedure is relatively simple and
	straightforward. To begin installation of the Acrobat Reader
	program, follow these steps:

	    1. Start Windows. If Windows is already running, quit all
		other applications.

	    2. From the Program Manager, click on the drive on which
		your CD-ROM resides. In most cases, this will be the
		D: drive.

	    3. Click on the AASETUP.EXE file within the \READER\DISK1
		directory. The Acrobat Reader license agreement screen
		appears.

	    4. If you accept the license agreement conditions for the
		Acrobat Reader software, click Accept. The Acrobat
		Reader Installer dialog box appears.

	    5. Unless you are reinstalling either the Acrobat Reader
		or ATM program, leave both check boxes selected and
		click Install.

	    6. If you do not want to install the Acrobat Reader Tour,
		deselect the check box for that item. The dialog box
		shows how much disk space is required for the items
		you choose to install. 

	    7. Choose a target directory to place the Acrobat Reader
		software on your hard disk, or accept the default
		directory of C:\ACROREAD

	    8. Click Install. A message appears asking you to complete
		and return the registration card provided on-line in
		the file REGCARD.PDF

	    9. Click OK. A dialog box appears asking you for your
		name, organization and serial number. Note that the
		serial number has already been opaquely filled in.

	   10. Click OK. The installer begins copying files to your
		hard disk.

		INSTALLING THE ATM SOFTWARE

	   11. If you chose to install the ATM software in step 5 (as
		you should have), a dialog appears asking you for the
		default target directories to install the ATM software
		and the provided Postscript fonts. Choose this
		directory or accept the defaults (C:\PSFONTS).
		(Usually, it is best to accept the defaults. Many
		applications expect to find Postscript language fonts
		in C:\PSFONTS.)

	   12. Click install. The ATM installer copies the files to
		your hard disk. When the ATM installer finishes
		copying font files to your hard disk, a message
		appears prompting you to either restart Windows or
		exit to DOS.

	
	  13. Click Restart Windows to restart Windows and return to
		the Program Manager.


-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	STARTING THE ACROBAT READER PROGRAM

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	The Acrobat Reader Installer creates a program group called
	Adobe and places the Acrobat Reader program icon in that
	group. Double-click on the icon in that group to start the
	Adobe Acrobat Reader.

	The Acrobat Reader Installer places the following files in the
	application directory. Use these files if you need to learn
	how to use Acrobat Reader:

	    o HELPREAD.PDF, an on-line guide to using the Acrobat
		Reader program.

	    o TOURREAD.PDF, an on-line tour through the features of
		Acrobat Reader.

	    o REGCARD.PDF, a registration card that you can print out
		and submit to Adobe.

	    o LICENSE.PDF, Adobe's license agreement.
		
	    o SUPPORT.PDF, Adobe's support plans for their products.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	HOW TO VIEW THE SDK DOCUMENTATION USING THE READER

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Adobe Acrobat Reader views files in their PDF format. These
	files are appended with the .PDF suffix. The source files of
	the SDK documentation in this .PDF format are available in
	\PCGEOS\TECHDOCS\ACROBAT.

	To view the SDK documenation, start the Acrobat Reader and
	select one of the files in the \PCGEOS\TECHDOCS\ACROBAT
	directory. The file will be opened on the first (cover) page
	of the book.

	NOTE: Adobe Acrobat is not compatible with the Hercules
	display type. We at Geoworks have also experienced odd color
	schemes using the CL-GD5426/CLGD5428 display type (the
	background color appeared as yellow rather than white). If you
	prefer the white background try a different display type. 

	To aid in searching through the SDK documentation, we have
	provided Bookmarks (hyperlinks) to every Table of Contents
	(and other additional locations) in every book. To view these
	Bookmarks, click on the Bookmark button (the middle button in
	the upper left-hand row of buttons below the menu bar). The
	Bookmarks will appear in the left-hand margin.

	To navigate to a topic listed in the Bookmarks, double-click
	on the page icon within the Bookmark. The book will flip to
	that page. You can then use the Table of Contents, the 'Goto
	Page' button, and the 'Find' utility to find a topic.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

		HOW THE DOCUMENTATION IS ORGANIZED

        ***		CONCEPTS MANUAL			*** 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

        The Concepts book gives comprehensive conceptual information on
        the GEOS system software, from a basic system architecture
	overview to application construction to the various kernel
	services available. Because the Concepts book is so large, you
	may want to print out the table of contents for the format you
	will use the most. 

        The files in the Concepts book explain the GEOS system software
        and how to program for it.  You should, after reading the Tutorial
        book, begin with the Concepts book's first five or six chapters.

	***		OBJECTS MANUAL			***

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

        The Objects book gives complete information on all the object
	classes included in the GEOS system software.  This includes
	all the generic UI classes, the MetaClass class, and all the
	higher-level objects you can plug into your applications.  You
	will probably want to print out the table of contents and keep
	it handy for use while programming and debugging.

	Each chapter in the Objects book describes one or more
	classes. In all cases, the description of a class will also
	direct you to its superclass.  For a description of which
	objects to use in which cases, you should look in the Concepts
	book, "Building an Application" chapter. 

	The chapter in the Objects book are listed below:

	***		ESP MANUAL			*** 

-----------------------------------------------------------------------
	
	The Esp Manual contains a programming guide for the GEOS
	Assembly Language (known as "Esp"). Although this guide will
	not teach basic Assembly language, it lets people who know
	how to program in 80x86 Assembly Language apply that
	knowledge to writing for GEOS.  We have also provided sample
	applications written in assembly language; these are
	excellent supplementary documentation.  The sample
	applications are in \PCGEOS\APPL\SDK_ASM. 

	The Esp Manual contains the following chapters:

	 Table of Contents	Table of contents for the entire Esp
				book. 
	 Intro to Esp		Introduction to Esp, and roadmap for
				the Esp book.
	 Esp Masics		Basic Esp information, and differences 
				betweeen Esp and other 80x86 assembly
				languages. 
	 Routine Writing	Writing routines and message-handlers
				in Esp. 
	 The UI Compiler	Using the Esp User-Interface Compiler
				to create object blocks.

         ***		C REFERENCE MANUAL		***

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

         The C reference book contains reference entries for all the
	 kernel and library routines, structures, GOC keywords, and
	 Glue parameter keywords. 
         All entries in the C Reference begin with the characters
         n<tab>; the n-tab combination can be searched for when
         you want to see all reference entries in a file.

         This book has no table of contents file in the ASCII version, but
         its structure is simple: it is arranged alphabetically.  There are
         four basic sections, as shown below:

          GOC Keywords   All the GOC keywords are listed alphabetically in
                        the RGOC file.
          Glue Parameter Keywords
                        The Glue linker gets its parameters from a file with
                        the suffix .GP.  In this file are several keyword
                        entries; the RGP file in the Routines book contains
                        an alphabetical listing of these keywords.

          Routines Reference
                        This chapter contains reference information
			for all routines provided by the kernel and
			GEOS libraries.  These are arranged
			alphabetically, and sub-bookmarks have been
			provided to navigate through the alphabetical
			listing. 
          Structures Reference
                        This chapter contains reference information
			for all structures, records, enumerated types
			and unions defined by the kernel and GEOS
			libraries. These are arranged alphabetically,
			and sub-bookmarks have been provided to
			navigate through the alphabetical listing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	***		ASSEMBLY REFERENCE 		***

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

        The Assembly Reference book contains reference entries for
	all the kernel and library routines, structures, and Glue
	parameter keywords.

	The file contains the following chapters:  

         Glue Parameter Keywords
                        The Glue linker gets its parameters from a
			file with the suffix .GP.  In this file are
			several keyword entries; the RGP file in the
			Routines book contains an alphabetical listing
			of these keywords. 
         Routines Reference
                        This chapter contains reference information
			for all routines provided by the kernel and
			GEOS libraries.  These are arranged
			alphabetically, and sub-bookmarks have been
			provided to navigate through the alphabetical
			listing. 
         Structures Reference
                        This chapter contains reference information
			for all structures, records, enumerated types
			and unions defined by the kernel and GEOS
			libraries. These are arranged alphabetically,
			and sub-bookmarks have been provided to
			navigate through the alphabetical listing.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	***		QUICK REFERENCE GUIDE			***

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

        The Quick-Reference guide contains reference information for all
        the GEOS object classes in a minimal format.  It has no
	instructional text in it whatsoever. This manual is not meant
	to be an on-line reference; rather, we encourage you to print
	out the manual after you've gotten familiar with the object
	classes and their messages and routines.
 
        If printing from Acrobat, you should probably print
	"thumbnails," with two pages printed on each piece of paper
	(they are sized smaller than normal paper).  

	There are no "chapters" in the Quick-Reference book. The first
	page consists of Goc keywords; the remaining pages consist of
	Instance data, Messages and Routines for each class, organized 
	alphabetically for each class.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	***		ZOOMER PAMPHLET				***

-----------------------------------------------------------------------

	Included in the documentation is a special pamphlet with things
	to remember while developing Zoomer programs.  It contains hints
	and reminders about the Zoomer device itself and the constraints
	the device puts on you as developer.

    1.3  Suggested Reading Order

         It is recommended that ALL programmers read the entire Tutorial
         book before continuing into the more in-depth documentation.
         Following the Tutorial, you will get the best use of the
         documentation through reading the first five chapters of the
         Concepts book, printing out both the first two chapters for
         future reference (introduction and building an application).

         From there, you can decide what to read based on the topics you
         want to learn.  The UI overview chapter will help you get a
         grasp on UI issues, and you should refer to the building an
         application chapter frequently.
