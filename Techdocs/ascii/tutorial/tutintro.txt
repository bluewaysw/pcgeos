1Introduction

This book will help you set up your development 
stations, install your development kit software, and 
begin writing GEOS applications quickly. It is more 
than a simple tutorial for using the tools; it takes you 
step-by-step through a GEOS application from the very 
basics through using multiple files and displays.

		Who Should Read This Tutorial?

Nearly everyone. Anyone who hasn't programmed for 
GEOS before should follow all the steps in this manual, 
from hardware setup right through the end. This is not 
only for new programmers, but for all programmers; 
GEOS is almost certainly different from any other 
system you've ever programmed, and if you dive right 
in you're likely to be overwhelmed.

		What Will You Learn From This Tutorial?

You'll set up your hardware, and you'll install your 
software. Then, you'll learn how GEOS applications are 
structured, and you'll program an application that uses 
many of the user interface and object-oriented features 
of GEOS.
