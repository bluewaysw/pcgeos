1.  Overview of the Documentation

    The SDK documentation contains an immense amount of information about
    the GEOS system software, programming GEOS applications, and the GEOS
    SDK tool set.  It contains introductory, tutorial, conceptual, and
    reference information spanning the entire system.

    The documentation was created on Sun workstations using FrameMaker.
    It consists of several books as described in section 1.2 below.  It is
    provided in three electronic formats as shown in section 1.1 below,
    and it contains both indexes and tables of contents.  To learn how to
    use the different formats, read section 2 below.

    1.1  Three Formats

         As mentioned above and in README.TXT, the documentation is provided
         in three formats.

         1.1.1  Acrobat Format

         The Acrobat format files can be found on the CD in the
         \PCGEOS\TECHDOCS\ACROBAT directory. You don't need to buy the
	 software to view these files. This SDK contains a copy of the
	 Adobe Acrobat Reader software. To install the Acrobat Reader, 
	 consult the \ACROBAT.TXT file.

         This format is quite useful and more flexible than either of the
         other two.  You can view files and print out individual pages.
         Page numbers displayed in the Reader match up with page
	 numbers in the Tables of Contents; you can then use Acrobat's
	 'Go To Page' command, so you can quickly find a topic and
	 turn to the correct page.  

	 The Acrobat versions of the documentation also contain
	 "Bookmarks" which appear alongside the documentation in the
	 left margin. These bookmarks allow you to quickly navigate
	 (via hypertext links) to other parts of the book. The Bookmarks
	 have been set up to navigate to individual Tables of Contents
	 for individual chapters. From that point, you can find your
	 topic, retrieve its page number and turn to the correct page.
         Furthermore, the diagrams are all as they appear on the printed
         page.  (Diagrams are lost in ASCII format.)  Reference information
         is similarly easier to read due to the formatting.  Use Acrobat's 
	 built in search feature to find text strings in the documentation 
	 and look up topics quickly.

         The installation program for the SDK offers you the option of
         installing the Acrobat format documents onto your hard disk.
         If you think you may be accessing these files often, Geoworks
         recommends installing them to decrease disk access time. On
	 the other hand, access time to and from the CD-ROM is fairly
	 quick, so you may leave your Acrobat documents on the disk
	 unless you will need your CD-ROM for other purposes.

         1.1.2  ASCII Format

         All the documentation is provided in ASCII text format in the
         \PCGEOS-TECHDOCS\ASCII directory.  The ASCII files
	 unfortunately do not contain the diagrams or tables or
	 special formatting that can be found in the other two
	 formats.  They do, however, provide a universally-accessible
	 format and quick and easy access. 

         The ASCII format documents are also accessible through the Swat
         debugger.  The "doc" command will open the correct documentation
         file in a special Swat window and allow you to scroll around the
         file.  (In this case, the "correct" documentation file is the one
         that contains the reference information for the item requested.)
	 Within Swat, use the "help doc" command for more information.

         The ASCII documentation will be installed into a subdirectory
         of the host's development directory called TECHDOCS.  You can
         access these files or the ones on the CD-ROM.

         The ASCII format includes tables of contents and indexes.  Included
         in these files are the file names of the files referenced (not just
         the page numbers).  If you have a PostScript printer, the best way
         to access the information (if you don't have FrameReader) is to
         browse the text files (using a grep-like utility or a text
         viewer/editor) and then print out the PostScript files that you
         want.  Borland C comes with a grep utility.

         A peculiarity of the ASCII files is that many lines will begin with
         a single lower-case letter.  This is due to the formatting in the
         original Frame documents: these lower-case letters are
	 actually dingbats in the Acrobat and PostScript formats, but
	 translated to text they become ASCII letters.

         1.1.3  PostScript Format

         All the chapters in the SDK are also available in PostScript format
         for easy printing.  The PostScript files can be found in the
         \PCGEOS\TECHDOCS\PSCRIPT directory on the CD-ROM; they will
	 not be installed to your hard disk during installation unless
	 you explicitly indicate that option during Installation.

         Each PostScript file corresponds to an individual chapter, including
         that chapter's table of contents.  If you do not have a PostScript
         viewer but want to print out the PostScript files, look in the
         ASCII format documentation to find the files you want, then simply
         print the corresponding PostScript file.

----------------------------------------------------------------------

    1.2  Books in the Documentation

         All formats of the documentation contain all nine of the SDK
	 "books." The Acrobat directory contains nine individual
	 books. The ASCII and Postscript directories do not contain
	 individual books, but instead subdirectories for each book,
	 with each directory containing the individual files which
	 make up this book. 
 
         Each book is described below, with a list of the files it contains.
         For a suggested order of reading, see section 1.3 below.

         1.2.1  Tutorial and Setup

         The Tutorial book describes installation and setup of your SDK.
         It also begins with creating a sample application, which it
         then expands upon to get you familiar with the SDK tools and the
         basic GEOS programming concepts.

         We recommend that all programmers, even those with extensive
         C, C++ and GUI programming experience, go through the tutorial.  
	 The only exceptions are those programmers who have taken the  
         class offered by Geoworks, which covers many of the same topics.

         If you are viewing the files in ASCII or Postscript formats,
	 the files in the TUTORIAL directory are shown below.  Files whose 
         names end with TOC are tables of contents files for the similarly-
         named chapter files.

         The TUTOTOC.??? file (the ??? can be TXT or PS) file is the
         table of contents for the entire book.  The ASCII version of this
         file includes file names (without extensions) for the appropriate
         chapters and sections.

         TSAM4          Chapter 6, "Views and Visual Objects."  Adding
                        document saving and multiple displays.
         TSETUPCO       Appendix A.  Troubleshooting your serial connection.
                        This chapter echoes much information in INSTALL.TXT.

         1.2.2  Tools Reference

         The Tools Reference book describes all the tools included in the
         SDK as well as the system configuration and the GEOS .INI file.
         This book is found in the TOOLS directory of each format.
         The files in the Tools Reference are shown below.

         TOOLSTOC       The Tools book's table of contents.

                        the SDK.

         1.2.3  Concepts 

         The Concepts book gives comprehensive conceptual information on
         the GEOS system software, from a basic system architecture overview
         to application construction to the various kernel services available.
         Because the Concepts book is so large, you may want to print out the
         table of contents for the format you will use the most.  In addition
         to the table of contents, the Concepts book includes other directory
         files; these are shown below:

         CONCTOC        Table of contents for the entire Concepts book.
         CONCIX         Index for the entire Concepts book.
         CONCLOCE       List of C examples for the Concepts book.
         CONCLOFI       List of figures (diagrams) in the Concepts book.
                        Diagrams are not included in the ASCII version.

         The files in the Concepts book explain the GEOS system software
         and how to program for it.  You should, after reading the Tutorial
         book, read the Concepts book's first five or six chapters.
         After that you can skip around to the topics you feel most
         interested in.  The chapters in the book are

         CINTRO         The introduction to the documentation and to GEOS
                        in general.  You should read this and perhaps print it
                        out, as it gives an overview of the documentation.

	 1.2.4  Esp Manual

	 The Esp Manual contains a programming guide for the GEOS
	 Assembly Language (known as "Esp"). Although this guide will
	 not teach basic Assembly language, it lets people who know
	 how to program in 80x86 Assembly Language apply that
	 knowledge to writing for GEOS.  We have also provided sample
	 applications written in assembly language; these are
	 excellent supplementary documentation.  The sample
	 applications are in \PCGEOS\APPLICAT\SDK_ASM. Thse Esp Manual
	 has the following files:

	 ESPTOC		Table of contents for the entire Esp book.
	 ELOAEx		List of Assembly-language examples for the entire
			Esp book.
	 EINTRO		Introduction to Esp and roadmap for the Esp
			book.
	 EBASICS	Basic Esp information, and differences
			betweeen Esp and other 80x86 assembly languages.
	 EROUT		Writing routines and message-handlers in Esp.
	 EUIC		Using the Esp User-Interface Compiler to
			create object blocks.
	 EMIXING	Mixing C and assembly language in the same geode.


         1.2.5  Objects

         The Objects book gives complete information on all the object classes
         included in the GEOS system software.  This includes all the generic
         UI classes, the MetaClass class, and all the higher-level objects
         you can plug into your applications.  You will probably want to print
         out the table of contents file (OBJTOC) and keep it handy for use
         while programming and debugging.  In addition to the table of
         contents, there are several other directory-style files you may want
         to print out or use from time to time:

         OBJTOC         Table of contents for the entire Objects book.
         OBJIX          Index for the entire Objects book.
         OBJLOCEX       List of C examples for the Objects book.
         OBJLOFIG       List of figures for the Objects book.  Figures are
                        not included in the ASCII format chapters.
         OBJLOTAB       List of tables for the Objects book.  Not all tables
                        are not included in the ASCII format chapters.

         The files in the Objects book each describe one or more classes.
         In all cases, the description of a class will also direct you to
         its superclass.  For a description of which objects to use in which
         cases, you should look in the Concepts book, Building an Application
         chapter (CBUILD file).  The files in the Objects book are listed
         below:

         OSYSCLA        System classes including MetaClass, ProcessClass,
                        and GenProcessClass.
         OGEN           GenClass, including generic trees and the concepts
                        of the generic UI objects.

                        application can display application-specific data.
         OTEXT          GenTextClass and VisTextClass, along with all the
                        corresponding controller classes.
         OGENLST        The list management classes:  GenBooleanClass,
                        GenItemClass, GenBooleanGroupClass, GenItemGroupClass,
                        and GenDynamicListClass.

         OSYSOBJ        System classes including GenSystemClass, 
			GenScreenClass, and GenFieldClass.

         1.2.5  C Reference

         The C reference book contains reference entries for all the
	 kernel and library routines, structures, GOC keywords, and
	 Glue parameter keywords. 
         All entries in the C Reference begin with the characters
         n<tab>; the n-tab combination can be searched for when
         you want to see reference entries in a file.

         This book has no table of contents file in the ASCII version, but
         its structure is simple: it is arranged alphabetically.  There are
         four basic sections, as shown below:

         GOC Keywords   All the GOC keywords are listed alphabetically in
                        the RGOC file.
         Glue Parameter Keywords
                        The Glue linker gets its parameters from a file with
                        the suffix .GP.  In this file are several keyword
                        entries; the RGP file in the Routines book contains
                        an alphabetical listing of these keywords.
         Routine Reference Entries
                        All the files that begin RROUT contain reference
                        entries for the routines provided by the kernel and
                        GEOS libraries.  These are arranged alphabetically;
                        look at the file name for the appropriate part of the
                        alphabet.
         Structure Entries
                        All the files that begin RSTRUC contain reference
                        entries for the structures defined by the kernel and
                        GEOS libraries.  These are arranged alphabetically;
                        the name of a file reflects the section of the
                        alphabet in that file.

         1.2.6  Quick-Reference Guide

         The Quick-Reference guide contains reference information for all
         the GEOS object classes in a minimal format.  It has no text in it
         whatsoever; you may want to print this out after you've gotten
         familiar with the object classes and their messages and routines.
         If printing from Acrobat, you should probably
         print "thumbnails," with two pages printed on each piece of paper
         (they are sized smaller than normal paper).  The three files in
         this book are listed below:

         QR_CLAS1       This, along with the next file, gives the quick-
                        reference for all the object classes.
         QR_CLAS2       This, along with the previous file, gives the quick-
                        reference for all the object classes.
         QR_KEYWORDS    This gives quick-reference for all the GOC keywords.

    1.3  Suggested Reading Order

         It is recommended that ALL programmers read the Tutorial
         book before continuing into the more in-depth documentation.
         Following the Tutorial, you should read the first five chapters of 
	 the Concepts book, printing out both the first two chapters for
         future reference (introduction and building an application).

         From there, you can decide what to read based on the topics you
         want to learn.  The UI overview chapter will help you get a
         grasp on UI issues, and you should refer to the building an
         application chapter frequently.

    1.4  Zoomer Pamphlet

	 Included in the documentation is a special pamphlet with things
	 to remember while developing Zoomer programs.  It contains hints
	 and reminders about the Zoomer device itself and the constraints
	 the device puts on you as developer.  This document can be found
	 in the CD-ROM's \PCGEOS\TECHDOCS\<format>\ZOOMDOC file or
	 directory.

    2.3  Tutorial Information

         All the tutorial information is in the Tutorial book, which can
         be found on the CD-ROM in the \PCGEOS\TECHDOCS\*\TUTORIAL
	 files/directories. 
         The * in this case refers to each format directory.

    2.4  System Configuration Information

         When you need information about the system configuration--which
         files exist where on your host and target machines, what sample
         applications exist, what the PTTY environment variable is, etc.--
         you can look in the System Configuration chapter in Tools
	 book. If viewing an Acrobat file, double-click on the
	 Bookmark labelled 'System Configuration' in
	 \PCGEOS\TECHDOCS\ACROBAT\TOOLS.PDF. If viewing an ASCII
	 or Postscript file, this chapter is on the CD-ROM in the
	 following files: 

         \PCGEOS\TECHDOCS\ASCII\TOOLS\TCONFIG.TXT      ASCII format
         \PCGEOS\TECHDOCS\PSCRIPT\TOOLS\TCONFIG.PS     PostScript format

    2.5  Tools Reference Information

         For information on how to use the SDK tools, you should refer
         to the Tools Reference manual.  This can be found in all three
         formats, in the following files/directories:

	 \PCGEOS\TECHDOCS\ACROBAT\TOOLS		Acrobat book (not dir)
	 \PCGEOS\TECHDOCS\ASCII\TOOLS           ASCII format files
         \PCGEOS\TECHDOCS\PSCRIPT\TOOLS         PostScript format files
