	;  Creative labs defines what it calls a Sound Blaster Instrument
	;  file.  This is the layout of all the necessary information to
	;  configure a SB voice to sound like a specific instrument.
	;  These constants were taken from the Sound Blaster development
	;  kit.
	;  The actual voice envelope information takes up 11 bytes of
	;  space.  Each byte is just the value that should be loaded into
	;  a specific register of the board.  This makes it very easy
	;  to use for the Sound Blaster, but somewhat obscure.  As each
	;  byte contains much information, the corropsonding register
	;  records are included here to allow the production of your own
	;  voice envelopes.

	;
	;  Both the FM chip in the Casio Palm-top and the FM chip
	;  in the TANDY 1000 computers are remarkably similar.
	;  Each has three tone generators, with attenuation, and
	;  each has a noise generator.  Neither has internal support
	;  for envelopes, and they both formats for their sounds are
	;  remarkably similar.
	;
	;  In order to get the best sound possible, we will allow
	;  an instrument to define the proportional intensity of the
	;  1st, 2nd and 3rd partials (that is, the intensity of the
	;  base frequency to the specified volume, as well as the
	;  proportion of the 2nd and 3rd harmonics in comparison to
	;  the specified volume.)
	;  This should produce a well colored tone out of the chip
	;  when only one voice is sounding at a time.  The more voices
	;  which get used, however, the more bland the notes will sound.
	;  The intensity of each partial will be determined by first
	;  multiplying the basic volume by the setting, then dividing
	;  the result by the maximum possible setting.
	;
	;  Each instrument is also allowed to specify the type and
	;  intensity of the noise that is to be generated.

	;
	;  Each hardware device has its own capabilities.  It does little
	;  good to tell a device driver to set itself up with too little or
	;  too much information about the sound envelope.  Therefore, there
	;  are multiple formats that can be passed to and from the sound
	;  device.  A device should always try to do the best it can, but
	;  don't expect great things out of a device if you don't give it
	;  the information it wants.
