MouseEscape	etype	word, 0x8100, 1

DR_MOUSE_ESC_SET_MOUSE_COORD_BUFFER	enum	MouseEscape
;
;	Desc:	Set the circular buffer for storing mouse coordinates.
;		Called by the InkInputMonitor when it wants to get digitizer
;		coordinates. The mouse/digitizer driver will initialize
;		the circular buffer before using it.
;
;	Pass:	cx	= segment of fixed circular buffer
;			  (MouseCoordsCircularBufferStruct)
;	Return:	carry - set if error (function not supported)
;	Destroyed:	di
;

DR_MOUSE_ESC_REMOVE_MOUSE_COORD_BUFFER	enum	MouseEscape
;
;	Desc:	Remove the circular buffer for storing mouse
;		coordinates. The caller is responsible for freeing
;		the fixed buffer.
;	Pass:	nothing
;	Return:	carry - set if error (function not supported)
;	Destroyed:	di

;
; Circular buffer for digitizer coordinates. This buffer is shared between
; the digitizer driver and the InkInputMonitor and is used to pass the 
; absolute digitizer coordinates to the InkInputMonitor.
;
MouseCoordsCircularBufferStruct	struct
	MCCBS_nextRead	nptr.InkPoint
	; The offset of the next item in the circular buffer which the
	; InkInputMonitor is to read. This is updated by the InkInputMonitor 
	; and read by the digitizer driver to make sure it doesn't overwrite
	; items the InkInputMonitor has not read.

	MCCBS_nextWritten	nptr.InkPoint
	; The offset of the next item to be written in the circular buffer.
	; The digitizer driver keeps track of this.

	MCCBS_count	word
	; The number of items in the circular buffer which have not been
	; "passed" to the InkInputMonitor. The digitizer driver keeps track
	; of this.

MAX_MOUSE_COORDS	equ	256

	MCCBS_data	InkPoint	MAX_MOUSE_COORDS + 1	dup (<>)
	; Buffer for points.  It never fills up completely.  When
	; MAX_MOUSE_COORDS items are filled, it is considered full.
	; (We could keep a separate buffer-full flag instead, but then it's
	; troublesome synchronizing both the flag and MCCBS_nextRead between
	; the IM thread and the mouse driver interrupt code.)
	;
	; The mouse driver guarantees that a stroke passed to InkInputMonitor
	; does not start with an InkPoint whose IXC_TERMINATE_STROKE is set,
	; unless part of the same stroke has already been passed earlier.
	; (This can happen if the pen is already touching the digitizer when
	; the circular buffer is register, and then the pen leaves the
	; digitizer immediately.  In this case the mouse driver just won't
	; record the pen-up InkPoint in the buffer.)

;		within a certain screen area.

;		bx	= 1st y co-ordinate (usually top)
