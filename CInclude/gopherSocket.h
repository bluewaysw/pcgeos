 * ----------
 * 
 * The following constants would have to match exactly with the ones that
 * are defined in the application "socketTest" because we will be running
 * that application when we are testing the socket library.  That application
 * will provide the server side of the socket, and the Gopher client itself
 * will provide the client side.
